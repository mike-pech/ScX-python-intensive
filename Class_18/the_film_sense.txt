           TRANSLATOR'S NOTE

  Sergei Eisenstein's contribution to the film medium is
a double one-as film-maker and as film-teacher. Since
all but one of his six completed films have enj oyed
wide circulation in this country, his contribution as a
creative director is well-known. American and English
film-makers have had, ho\vever, only scattered oppor­
tunities to appreciate his contribution in the field of
theory.. His Soviet pupils in the State Institute of Cine­
matography are his chief beneficiaries in this regard.
  This film-maker's first book of theory is primarily for
the use of other film-makers. Yet, without any para­
doxical intent, it can be said that only such a profession­
ally aimed book can to any appreciable extent inform
the layman or the artist in another medium, or can
encourage the reader to dive below the surface of gen­
eral appreciation.
  One factor is so taken for granted in Eisenstein's
native land that it obviously seemed unnecessary to
stress it in this' text. He has discussed in detail certain
means whereby the spectator's reactions can be fused
with the creative process, producing a richer emotional
expression of a film's theme. But the thoroughness with
which he investigates these means should mislead no one
into assuming that in his view they represent ends in
themselves, or that an emotion or a sensation represents

 an end in itself. The purposive direction of the spec­
tator's emotion is a social responsibility, and all art in
the Soviet Union is conscious of that responsibility-in
time of peace as well as of war. This social function­
which today merits particular attention from our own
film-makers-underlines every word of Eisenstein's film
theory.
   Although this is Eisenstein's first book, its uncom­
promising persistence of argument will not surprise
readers who have followed his articles on film theory
as they have appeared in American and English journals.
For readers to whom the present work is an introduction
to Eisenstein as analyst, a guide to his earlier writing has
been provided among the appendices.
   The choice of documents in the appendices has been
governed largely by an effort to sho"v the stages of a
film concept on its way to completed film form-from
the first sketched structure of Que Viva Mexico, through
the notes for picture and sound images of Sutter's Gold,
through the first full outline of a sequence in An A111eri­
can Tragedy, to the blueprint of Ferghana Canal ready
                                                   -




for final construction. (The searching reader "vill dis­
cover in this last fragment evidence that Eisenstein has
employed the contents of this book to teach himself as
well as others.) The analysis of Alexander Nevsky in
Part IV, "Form and Content: Practice," covers that final
stage.
   Work on this book provided the kind of pleasure
which leaves no room for discussion of difficulties. The
only just complaints can C0111e from the many friends

  Although the author is himself of the profession and
knows the things that long practice, aided by much special
reflection, can teach him about it, he will not linger as
much as might be thought over that part of the art which
seems the whole of art to many mediocre artists, but with­
out which art would not exist. He will thus seem to en­
croach on the domain of the critics of esthetic affairs, men
who doubtless think that practice is not needed for them
to rise to speculative consideration of the arts.
  He will treat of philosophic more than of technical mat­
ters. That may seem singular in a painter who writes on
the arts : many semi-erudite men have treated the philoso­
phy of art. It would seem that their profound ignorance of
technical matters was looked on by them as a title to re­
spect, persuaded as they were that preoccupation with this
matter, so vital to every art, debarred professional artists
from esthetic speculation.
   It would seem almost that they had imagined a profound
ignorance of technical matters to be one reason more for
rising to purely metaphysical considerations, in a word that
preoccupation with a craft must render professional artists
rather unfit to rise to the heights which are forbidden to the
people outside esthetics and pure speculation.

WORD AND IM A GE
Every word has been permeated, as every image
has been transmuted, through the imaginative in­
tensity of one compelling creative act. "Consider
it well, " says Abt Vogler of the musician's anal­
ogous miracle :

Consider it well: each tone of our scale in itself is
    nought;
  It is everywhere in the world-loud, soft, and all is
    said:
Give it to 11ze to use! I mix it with two in my thought:
  And, tbere! Ye have heard and seen: consider and
                         --
   bow tbe head!

Give Coleridge one vivid word from an old nar­
rative ; let him mix it with two in his thought;
and then (translating terms of music into terms
of words) "out of three sounds he [will] frame,
not a fourth sound, but a star."

THERE was a period in Soviet cinema when montage
was proclaimed "everything." Now we are at the close
of a period during which montage has been regarded as
"nothing." Regarding montage neither as nothing nor
everything, I consider it opportune at this juncture to
recall that montage is just as indispensable a component
feature of film production as any other element of film
effectiveness. After the storm "for montage" and the
battle "against montage," we must approach its problems
simply and afresh. This is all the more necessary. because
in the period of "renunciation" of montage, its most in­
controvertible aspect, the one really immune to chal­
lenge, was also repudiated. The point is that the creators
of a number of films in recent years have so completely
"discarded" montage that they have forgotten even its
basic aim and function: that role set itself by every
work of art, tbe need for connected and sequential ex­
position of tbe tbenze, tbe 11Zaterial, tbe plot, tbe action,
the . movement within the film sequence and within the
film drama as a whole. Aside from the excitement of a
story, or even its logic or continuity, the simple matt�r'
of telling a connected story has often been lost in the
works of some outstanding film masters, working in
various. types of films. What "Te need, of course, is not
so much an individual criticism of those masters, but
                             3
4                  THE F ILM SENSE


primarily an organized effort to recover the montage
culture that so many have lost. This is all the more nec­
essary since our films are faced with the task of present­
ing not only a narrative that is logically connected, but
one that contains a maxhnum of e1notion and sthnulating
power.
   Montage is a mighty aid in the resolution of this task.
   Why do we use montage at all? Even the most fanat­
ical opponent of montage will agree that it is not merely
because the film strip at our disposal is n�t of infinite
length, and consequently� being condemned to working
with pieces of restricted lengths, ,ve have to. stick one
piece of it on to an<;>ther . occasionally ..
   The "leftists" of montage sa,v it from the opposite
extreme. While playing with pieces of film, they discov­
ered a certa�n property in ihe toy which kept them
astonished for �. number of years. This property con­
sisted in the fact that two {ihn pieces of any kind, placed
together, inevitably combine into a new concept, a new
quality, arising out of tbat jux!aposition.
   This is not in the least a circumstance peculiar to the
cinema, but is a phenomenon invariably. met with in all
cases where we have to deal with juxtaposition of two
facts, two phenome�a, two objects. We are accustomed
to make, almost automatically, a definite and obvious
deductive generalization when any separate objects are
placed before us side· by side. For example, take a grave,
juxtaposed with a woman in mourning weeping beside
it, and scar�ely anybody will fail to jump to the con­
clusion: a widow. It is precisely. on this feature of our
                  WORD AND       IMAGE                     5
perception that· the following miniature story by Am­
brose Bierce bases its effect. It is from his Fantastic
Fabies and is entitled "The Inconsolable Widow":
  A "'oman in widow's weeds was weeping upon a grave.
  "Console yourself, madam," said a Sym p athetic Stranger.
"Heaven's mercies are infinite. There is another man some­
where, besides your' husband, ,vith whom you can still be
happy."
  "There was," she sobb ed-"there 'vas, but this is his
grave." 3

   The whole effect of this is built upon the circum­
stance that the grave and the woman in mourning be­
side it lead to the inference, from established conven­
tion, that she is a widow mourning her husband, whereas
in fact the man for whom she is weeping is her lover.
   The same circumstance is often found in riddles-for
example, this one from international folk-lore: "The
raven flew, while a dog sat on its tail. How can this be?"
We automatically combine the juxtaposed elements and
reduce them to a unity. As a result, we understand the
query as though the dog were sitting 0t.1 the tail of the
raven, while actually, the riddle contains two unrelated
actions: the raven flies, while the dog sits on its own tail.
   This tendency to bring together into a unity two or
more independent objects or qualities is very strong,
even in the case of separate words, characterizing differ- .
ent aspects of some single phenomenon.
   An extreme instance of this can be found in that in­
ventor of the "portmanteau word," Lewis Carroll. His
modest declaration of his invention, of "two meanings
6                    THE FILM SENSE


packed into one ,vord like a portmanteau," concludes
his introduction to The Hunting of the Snark:
   For instance, take the two words "fuming" and "furious."
Make up your mind that you will say both words, but leave
it unsettled which you will say first. Now open your mouth
and speak. If your thoughts incline ever so little towards
"fuming," you will say "fuming-furious" ; if they turn,
by even a hair's breadth, towards "furious," you vvill say
. "furious-fuming" ; but if you have that rarest of gifts, a per­
  fectly balanced mind, you will say "frumious." 4

   Of course, in this instance we do not gain a new con­
cept, or a new quality. The charm of this "portmanteau"
effect is built upon the sensation of duality residing in
the arbitrarily formed single word. Every language has
its "portmanteau" practitioner-the American language
has its Walter Winchell. Obviously, the greatest mani­
pulation of the portmanteau word is to be found in
Finnegans Wake.
   Essentially, therefore, Carroll's method is a parody of
a natural phenomenon, a part of our common percep­
tion-the formation of qualitatively new unities; hence
it is a basic method of building comic effects.
   This comic effect is achieved through the perception
of both the new result and its two independent parts­
all at the same time. Instances of this kind of "vit are
innumerable. I shall cite here only three such examples
that on� can find - in Freud:
  During the war between Turkey and the Balkan States,
in 1912, PuncfJ depicted the part played by Roumania by
representing the latter as a highvvayman holding up the
                      WORD . AND   IMAGE                   7
members of the Balkan allianct.. The picture was entitled:
Kleptorou11zania. .   . .
   A narlghty j est of Europe has reb aptized a former poten­
tate, Leopold, into Cleopold because of his relation to a
lady surnamed Cleo. . . .

  In a short story . . . one of the characters, a "sport,"
speaks of the Christmas season as the alcoholidays. By re­
duction it can be easily seen that we have here a compound
word, a combination of alcohol and holidays . . . . 5

  I think it is apparent that the phenomenon we are dis­
cussing is more than widespread-it is literally universal.
   Hence there is nothing surprising in the circumstance
that a film audience also draws a definite inference from
the juxtaposition of two strips of film cemented to­
gether.
   We are certainly not criticizing all these facts, nor
their noteworthiness, nor universality, but simply the
false deductions and conclusions that have been drawn
from them. On this basis it will be possible to make the
necessary corrections.

   Of what omission were we guilty when vve first re­
marked the undoubted importance of the above phe­
nomenon to an understanding and mastery of montage?
What was true, and what false, in our enthusiastic dec­
larations at that time?
   The basic fact was true, and remains true to this day,
that the juxtapositibn of two separate shots by splicing
them together resembles not so much a simple sum of
one shot plus another shot-as it does a creation. It re-
8                  THE FILM SENSE


sembles a creation-rather than a s�m of its parts­
from the circumstance that in every such juxtaposition
tbe result is qualitatively distinguishable from each com­
ponent element viewed separately. At this late date no
one need really be reminded that quantity and quality
are not two different properties of a phenomenon. but·
only different aspects of the same phenomenon. This
law of physics is just as true in other spheres of science
and in art. Of the many fields to which it can be applied,
Professor Koffka's application of it to the field of be­
havior is apropos to our discussion:
   It has been said : The whole is more than the sum of its
parts. It is more correct to say that the whole is sOlnething
else than the sum of its parts, --because summing is a mean­
ingless procedure, whereas the whole-part relationship is
meaningful. 6

   The woman, to return to our first example, is a rep­
resentation, the n10urning robe she is wearing is a repre­
sentation-that is, both are objectively representable.
But "a widow," arising from a juxtaposition of the two
representations, is objectively unrepresentable-a new
idea, a new conception, a new image.
  What was the "distortion" in our attitude at that time
to this indisputable phenomenon?           .
   The error lay in placing the main emphasis on the
possibilities of juxtaposition, while less attention seemed
to be paid to the problem of analyzing the material that
was juxtaposed.
   lV1 y critics did not fail to represent this as a lack of
interest in the content of the film shot-pieces, confusing
                 WORD AND       IMAGE                   9
                  -      .


researc h in one aspect of a problem with the attitude of
the researcher to the representation of reality.
   I leave them to their consciences.
   The trouble arose from my having been charmed pri­
marily with that newly revealed featur� of the film
strips-that, no matter how unrelated they might be, and
frequently despite themselves, they engendered a "third
something" and became correlated when juxtaposed ac­
cording to the will of an editor.
   Hence I was preoccupied by a potentiality untypical
in normal film construction and film composition.
   Operating at the outset with such material and such
occurrences, it was natural to speculate principally upon
the potentialities of juxtaposition. Less attention was
given to an analysis of the actual nature of the pieces
juxtaposed. Such attention would not have been suffi­
cient in itself. History has proven that such attention,
directed solely to the content of single shots, led in
practice to a decline of montage to a level of "special
effects," "montage sequences," etc., with all the conse­
quences this involved.
   What should have been the proper emphasis, what.
should have received the principal attention, in order
that neither element would be unduly exaggerated?
   It was necessary to turn to that fundamental basis
which equally determines both the content enclosed by.
single frames and the compositional juxtaposition of
these separate contents with each other, i.e., to the con­
tent of the whole, of the general and unifying needs.
   One' extreme consisted in distraction with problems of
10                 THE F ILM SENSE


the technique of unification (the methods of montage),
the other-with the unified elements (the content of the
shot) .
   We should have occupied ourselves �ore with an ex­
amInation of the nature of the unifying principle itself.
This is precisely that principle which should determine
both the content of the shot and that content which is
revealed through a given juxtaposition of these shots.
   But with this in mind it was necessary for the re­
searcher's interest to be turned primarily not in the di­
rection of paradoxical cases, where this whole, general,
final result is not foreseen but emerges unexpectedly.
We should have turned to those cases where the shot­
pieces are not only not unrelated to each other, but
where this final, this general, this whole result is not
merely foreseen, but itself predetermines both the in­
dividual elements and the circumstances of their juxta­
position. Such cases are normal, generally accepted and
frequent in occurrence. In such cases the whole emerges
perfectly as "a third something."- The full picture of the
whole, as determined both by the shot and by montage,
also emerges,. vivifying and distinguishing both the con­
tent of the shot and the content of the montage. It is
cases of this kind that are typical for cinematography.
   With montage considered in this light, both single
shots and their juxtaposition fall into a correct mutual
relationship. In addition to this, the very nature of mon­
tage not only ceases to be divorced from the principles
of realistic film delineation, but serves as one of the most
                  WORD AND IMAGE                        I I


coherent and practical resources for realistic narration
of film content.
   What is essentially involved in such an understanding
of montage? In such a case, each montage piece exists no
longer as something unrelated, but as a' given particular
representation of the general theme that in equal measure
penetrates all the shot-pieces. The juxtaposition of these
partial details ,in a given montage construction calls to
life and forces into the light that general quality in
which each detail has participated and which binds to­
gether all the details into a wbole, namely, into that gen­
eralized image,wherein the creator, followed by the
spectator, 'experiences the theme.
   If now we consider two pieces of film placed together,
we appreciate their juxtaposition in a rather different
light. Namely:
   Piece A (derived from the elements of the theme be­
ing developed) and piece B (derived from the same
source) in juxtaposition give birth to the image in which
the thematic matter is most clearly embodied.
   Expressed in the imperative, for the sake of stating
a more exact working formula, this proposition would

read:
   Representation A and representation B must be so se­
lected from all the possible features within the theme
that is being developed, must be so sought for, that their
juxtaposition-that is, the juxtaposition of tbose very ele­
ments and not of -alternative ones-shall evoke in the per­
ception and feelings of the spectator the most complete
image of the tbeme itself.
12                 THE   FILM SENSE


  Into our discussion of montage two new terms have
entered: "representation" and "image." I want to define
the demarcation between these terms before we proceed
further.

   We turn to an example for demonstration. Take a
white circular disc of average size and smooth surface,
its circumference divided into, sixty equal parts. At every
fifth division is set a figure in the order of succession of
I to 12. At the center of the disc are fixed two metal
rods, moving freely on their fixed ends, pointeq at
their free ends, one being equal to the radius of the
disc, the other rather shorter. Let the longer pointed rod
have its f.ree end resting ·at the figure 12, and the
sho.rter, in succession, h�ve its free end pointing toward
the figures I, 2, 3, and so on up to I 2. This will compris�
a series of geometrical; representations of successive re­
lations of the two metal rods to one another expressed
in the dimensions 30, 60, ,90 degrees, and so on up to
360 degrees.
   If, ho\vever, this disc be provided with a mechanism
that imparts steady movement to the metal rods, the
geometrical figure formed on its surface acquires a spe­
cial meaning: it is now not simply a representation, it is
an image of:· time.
   In this instance, the representation and the image it
evokes in our perception are so completely fused that
only under special conditions do we distinguish the
geometrical figure formed by the hands on the dial of
the clock from the concept of time. Yet this can happen
                  WORD AND IMAGE                         13

to any one of us, given, admittedly, the unusual circum­
stances.
   It happened to Vronsky after Anna Karenina tells
him that she is pregnant:
  When Vronsky looked at his watch on' the Karenins'
verangah he was so agitated and so preoccupied that he
sa,,, the hands and the face of the watch without realizing
the time.7

   In his case, the image of time created by the watch
did not arise. He saw only the geometrical representa­
tion formed by the watch dial and the hands.
   As we can see in even so simple an instance, where
the question touches only astronomical time, the hour,
the representation formed by the clock dial is insuf­
ficient in itself. It is not enough merely to see-:some­
thing has to happen to the rep�esentation, something
more has to be done with it, before it can cease to be
perceived as no more than a simple geometrical figure
and can become perceptible as the image of some par­
ticular "time" at which the event is occurring. Tolstoy
points out to us what happens when this process does
not take place.
   ",That exactly is this process? A given order of hands
on the dial of a · clock invokes a host of representations
associated with the time that corresponds to the given
                                                           ,
order. Suppose, for example, the given figure be five.
Our imagination is trained to respond to this figure by
calling to mind pictures of all sorts of events that occur
at that hour. Perhaps tea, the end of the day's work, the
                  THE    FILM SENSE


beginning of rush hour on the subway, perhaps shops
closing, or the peculiar late afternoon light . . . In any
case we will automatically recall a series of pictures
 (representations) of what happens at five o'clock.
   The image of five o'clock is compounded of all these
individual pictures.
   This is the full sequence of the process, and it is such
at the point of assimilating the representations formed
by the figures which evoke the images of the times of
day and night.
   Thereafter the laws of economy of psychic energy
come into force. There occurs "condensation" within
the process above described: the chain of intervening
links falls away, and there_ is produced instantaneous
connection between the figure and our perception of
the time to which it corresponds. The example of Vron­
sky shows us that a sharp mental disturbance can cause
this connection to be destroyed, and the representation
and the image become severed from each other.
   We are considering here the full presentation of the
process which takes place when an image is formed from
a representation, as described above.
   These "mechanics" of the formation of an image in­
terest us because the mechanics of its formation in life
turn out to be the prototype of the method of creating
ilnages in art. .
   To recapitulate: between the representation of an
hour on the dial of the clock and our perception of the
image of that hour, there lies a long chain of linked
representations of separate characteristic aspects of that
                  WORD AND IMAGE                       15

hour. And we repeat: that psychological habit tends to
reduce this intervening chain to a minimum, so that only
the beginning and the end of the process are perceived.
   But as soon as we need, for any reason, to establish a
connection between a representation and the image to be
evoked by it in the consciousness and feelings, we are
inevitably compelled to resort again to a chain of in­
tervening representations, which, in aggregate, form the
Image.
  Consider first an example approximating closely the
other example from everyday life.
   In New YorkCity most of the streets have no names.
Instead, they are distinguished by numbers-Fifth Ave­
nue, Forty-second Street, and so on. Strangers find this
method of designating streets extraordinarily difficult to
remember at first. We are used to streets with names,
which is much easier for us, because each name at once
brings up an image of the given street, i.e., when you
hear the street name, this evokes a particular complex
of sensations and, together with them, the image.
   I found it very difficult to remember the i111ages of
New York's streets and, consequently, to recognize the
streets themselves. Their designations, neutral numbers
like "Forty-second" or "Forty-fifth," failed to produce
images in my mind that vvould concentrate my percep­
tion on the general features of one or the other stre'et�
To produce these images, I had to fix in my memory a
set of objects characteristic of one or another street,
a set · o f objects aroused in my consciousness in answer

to the signal "Forty-second," and quite distinct from
                  THE FILlYI SENSE


those aroused by the signal "Forty-fifth." My memory
assembled the theaters, stores and buildings, character­
istic of each of the : streets I had to remember. This
process went through definite stages. Two of these
stages should be noted: in the first, at the verbal desig­
nation: "Forty-second Street," my memory with great
difficulty responded by enumerating the whole chain of
characteristic elements, but I still obtained no true per­
ception of the street because the various elements had
not yet been consolidated into a single image. Only in
the second stage did all the elements begin to fuse into
a single, emerging image: at the mention ·of the street's
"number," there still arose this whole host of its separate
elements, but now not as a -chain, but as something single
-as a whole characterization of the street, as its whole
zmage.
   Only after this stage could one say that one had· really
men10rized the street. The image of the given street be­
gan to emerge and live in the consciousness and percep­
tion exactly as, in the course 9f creating a work of art,
its single, recognizable whole image is gradually com­
posed out of its elements.
   In both cases-whether it be a question of memorizing
or the process of perceiving a work of art-the proce­
dure of entering the consciousness and feelings through
the whole, the whole through the image, remains obedi­
ent to this law.
   Further, though the image enters the consciousness
and perception through aggregation, every detail is pre­
served in the sensations and memory as part of the
                       WORD AND        IMAGE


whole. This obtains whether it be a sound image-some
rhythmic or melodic sequence of sounds, or whether it
be a plastic, a visual image, embracing in pictorial form
a remembered series of separate elements.
   In one way or another, the series of ideas is built up
in t �e perception and consciousness into a whole image,
storing up the separate elements.
   We have seen that in the process of remembering
there are two very essential stages: the first is the asse1n­
bling of the image, while the second consists in the result
of this assembly and· its significance for the memory. In
this ·latter stage it is important that the memory should
pay as little attention as possible to' the first stage, and
reach the result after passing through the stage of assem­
bling as swiftly as possible. Such is practice in life in
contrast to practice in art. For when we proceed into
the sphere of art, we discover a marked displacement of
emphasis. Actually, to achieve its result, a work of art
directs all the refinement of its methods to the process.
   A work of art, understood dynamically, is just this
process of arranging images in the feelings and mind of
the spectator. It is this that constitutes the peculiarity
                  *


of a truly vital work of art and distinguishes it from a
lifeless one, i� which the spectator receives the repre­
sented result of a given consummated process of cre­
ation, instead of being drawn into the process as it oc�
curs.
  •   Later we shall see that this same dynamic principle lies at the
base of. all truly vital images, even in such an apparently immobile
and stadc medium as, for example, painting.
18                  THE   FILl\·1 SENSE


  This :condition obtains everywhere and always, no
matter what the art form under discussion. For example,
the lifelike acting of an actor is built, not on his repre­
senting the copied results of feelings, but on his causing
the feelings to arise, develop, grow . into other feelings­
to live before the spectator.
   Hence the image of a scene, a sequence, of a whole
creation, exists not as something fixed and ready­
made. It has to arise, to unfold before the senses of the
spectator.
  In the same way a character (both in the writing and
in the performing of a role) , if it is to produce a genu­
inely living impression, must ·be built up for the specta­
tor in the course of �he actio?, and not be presented as
a clockwork figure with set a priori characteristics.

  In drama it is particularly important that the course
of the action should not only build up an idea of the
character, but also should build up, should "image," the
character itself.
  Consequently, in the actual method of creating images,
a work of art must reproduce -that process whereby,
in life itself, new images are built up in the human con­
sciousness and feelings.
   We have just shown the nature of this in our example
of the numbered streets. And we should be correct in
expecting an artist, faced with the task of expressing a
given image by factual representation, to resort to a
method precisely like this "assimilation" of the streets
of New York.
   We also used the example of the representation
                 WORD AND IMAGE


formed by the dial of a ciock, and revealed the process
whereby the image of time arises in consequence of this
representation. To create an image, a work of art must
rely upon a precisely analogous method, the construc­
tion of a chain of representations.
   Let us examine more broadly this example of time.
   With Vronsky, above, the geometrical figure failed
to come to life as an image of time. But there are cases
when what is important is not to perceive the hour of
twelve midnight chronometrically, but to experience
midnight in all the associations and sensations the author
chooses to evoke in pursuance of his plot. It may be an
hour of the anxious awaiting of a midnight assignation,
an hour of death at midnight, the hour of a fateful mid­
night elopement, in other words it may well be far from
a simple representation of the chronometrical hour of
twelve midnight.
   In such a case, from a representation of the twelve
strokes must emerge the image of midnight as a kind of
"hour of fate," charged with significance.
 " This can also be illustrated by an "example-this time
from iVlaupassant's Bel Ami. The example has an addi­
tional interest iIi that it is auditory. And yet another
because, in its nature pure montage, by the correctly
chosen method of its resolution it is presented in the
story as a narration of actual events.
   The scene is the one where Georges Duroy (who
n"ow writes his name Du Roy) is waiting in the cab for
Suzanne, "vho has agreed to flee with him at midnight.
   Here' twelve o'clock at night is only in the slightest
20                  THE   FILM SENSE


degree the chronometrical hour and is in the greatest
degree the hour at which all (or at any rate a very great
deal) is at stake. ("It is all over. It is a failure. Sbe won't
C   o'J1ze.")
   This is how Maupassant drives into the reader's con­
sciousness and feelings the image of this hour and its
significance, in distinction from a mere description of
the particular time of night:
   He went out towards eleven o'clock, .wandered ab out
some time, took a cab, and· had it drawn up in the Place
de la Concorde, by the Ministry of Marine. From time to
time he struck a match to see the tin1e by his watch. When .
he saw midnight approaching, his impatience becan1e fever­
ish. Every moment he thrust his head out of the window
to look. A distant clock struck-twelve, then another nearer,
then two together, then a last one, very far away. When
the latter had ceased to sound, he thought: "It is all over.
It is a failure. She won't come." He had made up his mind,
ho\vever, to wait till daylight. In these matters one must
be patient..
   He heard the quarter strike, then the half-hour, then the
quarter to, and all the clocks repeated "one," as they had
announced mid�ight. . . .8

   In this example, .we see that when .Maupassant
wanted to chisel into the reader's consciousness and sen­
sations the emotional quality of the midnight hour, he
did not confine himself to saying merely that first mid­
night struck and then one. He forced us to experience
the sensation of midnight by making twelve o'clock
strike in various places on various clocks. Combining in
our perception, these individual groups of twelve strokes
                  WORD AND IMAGE                         21

are built up into a general sensation of midnight. The
separate representations are built up into an image. This
was done entirely through montage.
   The example from Maupassant can serve as a model
for the most polished kind of montage. scripting, vvhere
"12 o'clock" in sound is denoted by means of a whole
    -




series of shots "from different camera-angles": "distant,"
"nearer," "very far away." This striking of the clocks,
recorded at various distances, is like the shooting of an
object from various camera set-ups and repeated in a se­
ries of three different shot-pieces: "long shot," "medium
shot," "distant shot." Moreover, the actual striking or,
more correctly, the varied striking of the clocks is
chosen not in the least for its virtue as a naturalistic
detail of Paris at night. The primary effect of t�is con­
flicting striking of clocks in lVlaupassant is the insistent
stressing of the emotional image of the "fateful midnight
hour," not the mere information that it is "12:00 P.M."
   If his object had been merely to convey the informa­
tion that it was then twelve o'clock at night, lVlaupassant
would scarcely have resorted to such a polished piece of
writing. Just as, without a .carefully chosen creative­
montage solution of this kind, he would never have
achieved, by such simple means, so palpable an emo­
tional effect.
   While we are on the subject of clocks and hours, I am'
reminded of an example from my own practice. During
the filming of October, we came across, in the Winter
Palace, ,a curious specimen of clock: in addition to the
main clock dial, it possessed also a wreath' of small dials
22                       THE   FILlYI SENSE


ranged around the rim of the large one. On each of the
dials was the name of a city: Paris, London, New York,
Shanghai, and so on. Each told the time as it happened
to be in each city, in contrast with the time in Petro­
grad shown by the main face. The appearance of this
clock stuck in our memory. And when in our film we
needed to drive home especially forcefully the historic
moment of victory and establishment of Soviet power,
this clock suggested a specific montage solution: we re­
peated the hour of the fall of the Provisional Govern­
ment, depicted on the main dial in Petrograd time,
throughout the whole series of subsidiary dials recording
the time in London, Paris, New York, Shanghai. Thus
this hour, unique in history and in the destiny of peoples,
emerged through all the multitudinous variety of local
readings of time, as though uniting and fusing all peoples
in the perception of the moment of victory. The same
 concept was also illuminated by a rotating movement of
 the wreath of dials itself, a movement which, as it grew
 and accelerated, also made a plastic fusion of all the dif­
 ferent and separate indices of time in the sensation of
 one single historic hour. . . .
    At this point I hear a question from my invisible op­
 ponents: "That's all very well for you � o say, but what
 about a single unbroken, uncut strip of film containing
 the performance of an actor-what has this to do with
 montage? Doesn't his acting, of itself, make an in1pres­
 sion? Doesn't the performance of a role by Cherkasov              *



     •   Nikolai Cherkasov, as Prof. Polezhayev in Baltic Deputy, the
Tzarevich Alexei in Peter tbe First, and as Alexander Nevsky.

or Okhlopkov, Chirkov t or Sverdlin t also make an
                     *


impression?" It is futile to suppose that this question in­
flicts a mortal blow on the conception of montage. The
principle of montage is far broader than such a question
assumes. It is entirely incorrect to assume'that if an actor
acts in a single unbroken strip of film, uncut by the di­
       _




rector and cameraman into different camera-angles, that
such a construction is untouched by montage! By no
means!
   In such a case all we have to do is look for montage
elsewhere, in fact, in the performance of the actor. And
the question of the extent to which the principle of
the "inner" technique of acting is related to montage we
shall discuss later. At the moment it will be sufficient to
let a leading artist of the stage and screen, Georg� Arliss,
contribute to this question:
   I had always believed that for the movies, acting must be
exaggerated, but I saw in this one flash that restraint was
the chief thing that the actor had to learn in transferring
his art from the stage to the screen. . . . The art of re­
straint and suggestion on the screen may any time be studied
by watching the acting of the inimitable Charlie Chaplin.9

  To emphasized representation (exaggeration) , Arliss
counterposes restraint. He sees the degree of this re-

Guerrilla Brigade.
                   THE   FILM SENSE


straint in the reduction of actuality to suggestion. He
rejects not merely the exaggerated representation of ac­
tuality, but even the representation of actuality in en­
tirety! In its place he counsels suggestion. But what is
"suggestion" if it not be an element, a detail of actuality,
a "close-up" of actuality, which, in juxtaposition with
other details, serves as a. determination of the entire frag­
ment of actuality? Thus, according to Arliss, the fused
effective piece of acting is nothing but a juxtaposition
of determining close-ups of this kind; combined, they
create the image of the acting's content. And, to proceed
further, the actor's acting may have the character of a
flat representation or of a genuine image according to
the 111ethod he uses to cons�!uct his performance. Even
though his performance be shot entirely from a single
set-up (or even from a single seat in a theater audito­
rium) , none the less-in a felicitous case-the perform­
ance will itself be "montage" in character.
   It should be remarked that the second example of
montage cited above (from October) is not an example
of everyday montage, and that -the first example (from
lVlaupassant) illustrates only a case where an object is
shot from various set-ups with various camera-angles.
   Another example that I will cite is quite typical for
cinematography, no longer concerned with an individual
object, but instead, with an image of a whole phenom­
enon-composed, however, in exactly the same way.
   This example is a certain remarkable "shooting­
script." In it, from a cumulative massing of contributory
details and pictures, an image palpably arises before us.

It was not written as a finished work of literature, but
simply as a note of a great master in which he attempted
to put down on paper for his own benefit his ,visualiza­

   The "shooting-script" to which I refer is Leonardo
d�r Vinci's notes on a representation of The Deluge in
painting. I choose this particular example because in it
the audio-visual picture of The Deluge is presented with
an unusual clarity. Such an accomplishment of sound
and picture co-ordination is remarkable coming ''. from
any painter, even Leonardo:

headlong into these very torrents and choke up the valleys,

Again there might be seen huddled together on the tops
 of many of the mountains many different sorts of anima�s,
,terrified a!ld subdued at last to a state of tameness, in com- '

waters to roll over and over in mighty hurricane, bearing
with them the bodies of the drowned;

and there was no obj ect that floated on the water but was
covered with various different animals who had made truce
and stood huddled together in terror, among them wolves,
foxes, snakes and creatures of every kind, fugitives from
death.

And all the waves that beat against their sides were striking
them with repeated blows from the various bo dies of- the
drowned, and the blows were killiIig those in whom life
remained.

Some groups of men you might have seen with weapons
in their · hands defending the tiny footholds that remained to
them from the lions and wolves and beasts of prey which
sought safety there.

Ah, what dreadful tumults one heard resounding through

How many boats were capsized and lying, some whole,

Others with frenzied acts were taking their own lives, in
despair of ever being able to endure such anguish ;

Herds of animals, such as horses, oxen, goats, sheep, were
to be seen already hemmed in by the waters and left iso­

together,

and those in the middle climbing to the top and treading
on the others, and . waging fierce battles with each other,
and many of them dying from want of food.

And the birds had already begun to settle upon men and
other animals, no longer finding any land left unsubmerged
which was not covered with living creatures.

Already had hunger, the minister of death, taken away their
life fron1 the greater number of animals, when the dead

   The foregoing was not intended by its author as a

move111ent. Moreover, the course of this 11'lOVe'J11ent is
not in the least fortuitous. The movement follows a
definite order, and then, in corresponding reverse order,
returns to phenomena matching those of the opening.
Beginning with a description of the heavens, the picture
ends with a similar · description, but considerably in­
creased in intensity. Occupying the center is the group
of humans and their experiences; the scene develops
from the heavens to the humans, and from the humans
to the heavens, passing groups of animals. The d�tails of
largest scale (the close-ups) are found in the center, at
the climax of the description ( . . . hands clenched and
                                "


fingers locked togetber . . . bites tbat ran blood . . . ") .
In perfect clarity emerge the typical elements of a
montage composition.
   The content within each frame of the separate scenes
is enforced by the increasing intensity in the action.
   Let us consider what we may call the "animal theme":
animals trying to escape; animals borne by the flood ; ani­
mals drowning; animals struggling with human beings;
animals fighting one another; the carcasses of drowned .
animals floating to the surface. Or the progressive dis­
appearance of terra firma from under the feet of the
people, ,animals, birds, reaching its culmination at the
point where the birds are forced to settle on the humans
                  THE   FILM SENSE


and animals, not finding any unsubmerged and unoccu­
pied land. This passage forcibly recalls to us that the
distribution of details in a picture on a single plane also
presumes movement-a compositionally directed move­
ment of the eyes from one phenomenon to another.
Here, of course, movement is expressed less directly than
in the film, where the eye cannot discern the succession
of the sequence of details in any other order than that
established by him who determines the order of the
montage.
   Unquestionably though, Leonardo's exceedingly se­
quential description fulfiUs the task not of merely listing
the details, but of outlining the trajectory of the future
movement of the attention over the surface of the can­
vas. Here we see a brilliant example of how, in the ap­
parently static simultaneous "co-existence" of details in
an immobile picture, there has yet been applied exactly
the same montage selection, there is exactly the same
ordered succession in the juxtaposition of details, as in
those arts that include the time. factor.
   Montage has a realistic significance when the separate
pieces produce, in juxtaposition, the generality, the syn­
 thesis of one's theme. This is the image, incorporating
 the theme.
   Turning from this definition to the 'creative process,
we shall see that it proceeds in the following manner.
 Before the inner vision, before the perception of the
 creator, hovers a given image, emotionally embodying
 his theme. The task that confronts him is to transform
 this image into a few basic partial representations which,
                  WORD AND IMAGE                         31

in their combination and Juxtaposition, shall evoke in
the consciousness and feelings of the spectator, reader,
or auditor, that same initial general image which orig­
inally hovered before the creative artist.
  This applies both to the image of the work of art as
a w�ole and the image of each separate scen� or part.
This holds true in precisely the same sense for the actor's
creation of an image.
  The actor is confronted with exactly the same task:
to express, in two, three, or four features of a character
or of a mode of behavior, those basic elements which in
juxtaposition create the integral image that was worked
out by the author, director and the actor himself.
  What is most noteworthy in such a method? First
and foremost, its dynamism. This rests primarily in the
fact that the desired image is not fixed or ready �made,
but arises-is born. The image planned by author, direc­
tor and actor is concretized by them in separate repre­
sentational elements, and is assembled-again and finally
-in the spectator's perception. This is actually the final
aim of every artist's creative endeavor.
   Gorky put this eloquently in a letter to Konstantin
Fedin:
   You say : You are worried by the question, "how to
write? " I have been watching for 2 5 years how that ques-:­
tion worries people . . . Yes, it is a serious question; I
have worried about it myself, I do \vorry ab out it, and I
shall go on worrying about it to the end of my days. But
for me the question is formulated : Ho\v must I write so
that the man, no matter who he may be, shall emerge from
32                   THE    FILM SENSE


the pages of the story about him with that strength of
physical palpability of his existence, with that cogency of
his half-imaginary reality, with which I see and feel him?
That is the point as I understand it, that is the secret of the
matter . . . . 1 2

   Montage helps in the resolution of this task. T,�e
strength of montage resides in this, that it includes in
the creative process the emotions and mind of the spec­
tator. The spectator is compelled to proceed along that
selfsame creative road that the author traveled in cre­
ating the image. The spectator not only sees the repre­
sented elements of the finished work, but also experi­
ences the dynamic process of the - emergence and assem­
bly of the image just as it was experienced by the author.
And this is, obviously, the highest possible degree of
approximation to transmitting visually the author's per­
ceptions and intention in all their fullness, to transmit­
ting them with "that strength of physical palpability"
with which they arose before the author in his creative
work and his creative vision.       _




   Relevant to this part of the discussion is Marx's defi­
nition of the course of genuine investigation:
  Not only the result, but the road to it also, is a part of
truth. The investigation of truth must i�self be true, true
investigation is unfolded truth, the disj uncted members of
which unite in the result. 1 3 *

  .. Zur Wahrheit gehort nicht nur das Resultat, sondern auch cler
Weg. Die Untersuchung der Wahrheit muss selbst wahr sein, die
wahre Untersuchung ist die entfaltete Wahrheit, deren auseinander
gestreute Glieder sich im Resultat zusammenfassen.
                  WORD AND IMAGE                        33

   The strength of the method resides also in the circum­
stance that the spectator is drawn into a creative act in
which his individuality is- not subordinated to the au­
thor's indjviduality, but is opened up throughout the
process of fusion with the author's intention, just as the
individuality of a great actor is fused with the individ­
uality of a great playwright in the creation of a classic
scenic image. In fact, every spectator, in correspondence
with his individuality, and in his own way and out of
his own experience-out of the womb of his fantasy, out
of the warp and weft of his associations, all conditioned
by the premises of his character, habits and social appur­
tenances, creates an image in accordance with the repre­
sentational guidance suggested by the author, ' leading
him to understanding and experience of the a,uthor's
theme. This is the same image that was planned and cre­
ated by the author, but this image is at the same time
created also by the spectator himself.
   One might think that nothing could be more definite
and clear than the almost scientific listing of the details
of The Deluge as they pass before us in Leonardo's
"shooting-script." Yet how personal and individual are
the resulting images that arise in the mind of each reader,
deriving from a specification and juxtaposition of details
which are shared by all readers of, such a documen�.
Each is just as similar and as dissimilar as would be the
role of Hamlet or Lear played by different actors of
different countries, periods, or theaters.
   Maupassant offers every reader the same montage con-
                   THE   FILM SENSE
34

struction for the striking of the clocks. He knows that
this particular construction will evoke in the perception
more than mere information of the hour of night. An
experience of the significance of the hour of midnight
will be evoked. Each reader hears· the striking of the
hour identically. But in each reader is born an image of
his own, his own representation of midnight and its sig­
nificance. Each such representation is, in the image sense,
individual, dissimilar, and yet identical thematically. And
each such image of midnight, while being for every
reader at the same time also that of the author, is also
equally his own-living, close, intimate.
   The image planned by the author has become flesh of
the flesh of the spectator's-risen image. . . . Within me,
as a spectator, this image is born and grown. Not only
the author has created, but I also-the creating spectator
-have participated.
   At the beginning of this chapter I spoke of an emo­
tionally exciting and moving story as distinguished from
a logical exposition of facts-as much difference as there
is between an experience and an affidavit.
   An affidavit-exposition would be the corre�ponding
non-montage construction in each of the examples that
 have been cited. In the case of Leonardo da- Vinci's
 notes for The Deluge, an affidavit-exposition would not
 have taken into consideration as he did the various scales
 and perspectives to be distributed over the surface of
 the finished picture, according to his calculations- of the
 trajectory of the spectator's eyes. It would have been
                       WORD AND IMAG:C                              35

satisfied by a mere display of the dial of a clock telling
the exact time of the overthrow of the Provisional Gov­
ernment. If Maupassant had used such a method in the
passage of Duroy's appointment, it would · have been a
curt item of information that the hour of twelve struck.
In other words such an approach conveys bare docu­
mentary information, not raised by means of art to a
created exciting force and emotional affect. As affidavit­
expositions, these examples would all be, in film terms,
representations sbot from a single set-up. But, as fash­
ioned by artists, they constitute i1nages, brought to life
by means of montage construction.
   And now we can say that it is precisely the montage
principle, as distinguished from that of representation,
which obliges spectators themselves to create and the
montage principle, by this means, achieves that great
power of inner creative excitement in the spectator
                                                *


which distinguishes an emotionally exciting work from
one that stops without going further than giving in­
formation or recording events.
   Examining this distinction we discover that the mon­
tage principle in films is only a sectional application of
  •   It is quite obvious that the theme as such is capable of exciting
emotionally, independently of the fonn in which it is presented. A
brief newspaper report of the victory of the Spanish Republicans ,at .
Guadalajara is more moving than a work by Beethoven. But \ve are
discussing here how, by means of art, to raise a given theme or sub­
ject, that may already be exciting "in itsel f," to a maximum degree
of atfectiveness. It is further quite obvious that montage, as such, is
in no way an exhaustive means in this field, though    a   tremendously
powerful one.
                  THE   FILM SENSE


the montage principle in general, a . principle which, if
fully understood, passes far beyond the limits of splicing
bits of film together.

    As stated above, the compared montage methods of
creation by the spectator and creation by the actor can
lead to absorbing conclusions. In this comparison a meet­
ing occurs between the montage method and the sphere
of the inner technique of the actor; that is, the form of
that inner process through which the actor creates a liv­
ing feeling, to be displayed subsequently in the truthful­
ness of his activity on the stage . or on the screen.
    A number of systems and doctrines have been erected
upon the problems of the actor's performance. More ac­
curately, there are really two or three systems with vari­
ous offshoots. These offshoot schools are distinguished
one from the other not merely by differences in termi­
nology, but chiefly by their varying conceptions of the
principal role played by different basic points of acting
technique. Sometimes a school almost completely forgets
an entire link in the psychological process of image­
creation. Sometimes a link that is not basic is raised to
the foremost place. Within even such a monolith as the
method of the Moscow Art Theatre, with all its body
 of basic postulates, there are independent offshoots in
 the interpretation of these postulates.
    I have no intention of delving into the nuances of
 either essential or terminological differences in niethods
 of training or creation vlith the actor. Our purpose here
 is to consider those features of inner technique which
                   WORD AND IMAGE                          37

enter necessarily arid directly into the technique of the
actor's work and enable it to achieve results-seizing the
imagination of the spectator. Any actor or director is,
as a matter of fact, in a position to deduce these features
from his own "inner" practice, if he would but manage
to halt that process in order to examine it. The tech­
niques of the actor and the director are, in regard to this
section of the problem, indistinguishable, since the di­
rector in this process is also, to some extent, an actor.
From observations of this "actor's share" in my own
directorial experience, I shall try to outline this inner
technique we are considering through a concrete ex­
ample. In so doing there is no intention of saying any­
thing new on this particular question.
   Let us suppose that I am faced with the problem of
playing the "morning after" of a man who, the night
before, has lost government money at cards. Suppose the
action to be full of all kinds of matters, including, let us
say, a conversation with a completely unsuspecting wife,
a scene with a daughter gazing intently at her father
whose behavior seems strange, a scene of the embezzler
nervously awaiting the telephone call that is to call him
to account, and so on.
   Suppose that a series of such scenes leads the embez­
zler into an attempt to shoot himself. The task before
the actor is to act the final fragment of the climax, whe�e
he arrives at this realization that there is only one solution
-suicide-and his hand begins to fumble in the drawer
of his writing-table, searching for the revolver . . . .
   I believe that it would be almost impossible to find
                   THE FILM SENSE


an actor of any training today who in this scene would
start by trying to "act the feeling" of a man on the point
of suicide. Each of us, instead of sweating and straining
to imagine how a man would behave under such circum­
stances, would approach the task from quite another
direction. We should compel the appropriate conscious­
ness and the appropriate feeling to take possession of us.
And the authentically felt state, sensation, experience
would, in direct consequence, "manifest" itself in true
and emotionally correct movements, actions, general be­
havior. This is the way towards a discovery of the ini­
tiating elements of correct behavior, correct in the sense
that it is app ropriate to a genuinely experienced state or
feeling.
   The next stage of an actor's work consists in compo­
sitionally sorting these elements, cleansing them of every
fortuitous accretion, refining the premises to the furthest
degree of expressiveness. But this is the following stage.
Our concern here is with the stage preceding this.
   We are interested in that part of the process in \vhich
the actor becomes possessed by the feeling. How is this
achieved? We have already said that it cannot be done
with the "sweating and straining" method. Instead ,ve
pursue a path that should be used for all such situations.
   What we actually do is compel o�r imagination to
depict for us a number of concrete pictures or situations
appropriate to our theme. The aggregation of the pic­
tures so imagined evokes in us the required emotion, the
feeling, understanding and actual experience that we are
seeking. Naturally the material of these imagined pic-
                  WORD AND IMAGE                          39

tures will vary, depending on the particular characteris­
tics of the character and image of the person being
played by the actor at the time.
   Suppose that a characteristic feature of our embezzler
be fear of public opinion. What will chiefly terrify him
will- not be so much the pangs of conscience, a con­
sciousness of his guilt or the burden of his future impris­
onment, as it will be "what will people say? "
   Our man, finding himself in this position, "vill imagine
first of all the terrible consequences of his act in these
particular terms.
   It will be these imagined consequences and their com­
binations which will reduce the man ,to such a degree
 of despair that he will seek a desperate end.
   This is exactly how it takes place in life. Terror result­
                                                    -
ing from awareness of responsibility initiates his feverish
pictures of the consequences. And this host of imagined
pictures, reacting on the feelings, increases his terror, re­
 ducing the embezzler to the utmost limit of horror and
 despair.
   The process is exactly similar to that by which the
 actor induces a similar state in the conditions of the
 theater. A difference exists only in his use of will to
 force his imagination to paint the same pictured conse­
 quences that in life a man's imagination would a\vake
 spontaneously.
    The methods whereby the imagination is induced to
 do this on the basis of presumed and imaginary circum­
 stance� are not at the moment pertinent to my exposi­
 tion. We are dealing with the process from the point
                  THE FILM SENSE

where the imagination is already depicting whatever is
necessary for the situation. It is not necessary for tl �
actor to force himself to feel and experience the foreseen
consequences. Feeling and experience, like the actions
that flow from them, arise of themselves, called to life
by the pictures his imagination paints. The living feeling
will be evoked by the pictures themselves, by their ag­
gregation and juxtaposition. In seeking ways of waking
the required feeling, one can depict to oneself an innu­
merable quantity of relevant situations and pictures that
all advance the theme in various aspects.
   By way of example I shall take the first couple of situ­
ations that come to me from the multiplicity of imagined
pictures. Without weighing them carefully I shall try
to record them here as they occur to me. "I am a crim­
inal in the eyes of my former friends and acquaintances.
People avoid me. I am ostracized by them," and so on.
To feel this through all my senses I follow the process
outlined above by depicting to myself concrete situ­
ations, actual pictures of the f�te that awaits me.
   The first situation in which I imagine myself is the
courtroom where my case is being tried. The second
situation will be my return to normal life after serving
my sentence. These notes will attempt to reproduce the
plastic and graphic qualities that such multifold frag­
mentary situations naturally possess when our imagina­
tion is fully functioning. The manner in which such
situations arise differs with each actor.
   This is merely what came to 712Y mind when I set
my self the task:
                  WORD AND IMAGE

   The courtroom. My case is being tried. I am on the
stand. The hall is crowded with people who know me­
some casually, some very well. I catch the eye of my neigh­
bor fixed upon me. For thirty years we lived next door to
each other. He notices that I have caught him staring at me.
His eyes slip past me with feigned abstraction. He stares
out of the window, pretending boredom. . . . Another
spectator in court-the woman who lives in the apartment
above mine. Meeting my look, she drops her gaze terrified,
while watching me out of the corners of her eyes. . . .
With a clearly motivated half-turn my usual billiards part­
ner presents his back to me. . . . There are the fat owner
of the billiards parlor and his wife-staring at me with set
insolence. . . . I try to shrink by gazing at my feet. I see
nothing, but all around me I hear the whisper of censure
and the murmur of voices. Like blow upon blow fall the
words of the prosecuting attorney's summing-up. . . .

   I imagine the other scene with the same vividness-my
return from prison:
   The clang of the gates closing behind me as I am released
. . . The astonished stare of the servant girl, who stops
cleaning the windows next door when she sees me enter
my oid block . . . There is a new name on the mail-box.
. . . The floor of the hall has been newly varnished and
there is a new mat outside my door. . . . The door of.the
next apartment opens. People whom I have never seen look
out suspiciously and inquisitively. Their children huddle
against them; they instinctively withdraw from my appear­
ance. From below, his spectacles awry on his nose, the o,ld
janitor, who remembers me from the past, stares up the·
stair-well. . . . Three or four faded letters sent to my ad­
dress before my shame was generally known . . . T\vo or
three coins j ingling in my pocket . . . And then-my door
is closed in my face by the former acquaintances who now
                   THE FILM SENSE

occupy my apartment. . . . My legs reluctantly carry me
up the stairs towards the apartment of the woman I used to
know and then, when there are only two further steps to
go, I tum back. The hurriedly raised collar of a passer-by
who recognizes me . . .

    And so on. The above is the result- of merely j otting
 down all that crowds through my consciousness and
 feelings when, either as director or actor, I try to get
an emotional grasp of the proposed situation.
   After mentally placing myself in the first situation
and then mentally passing through the second, doing the
same- with two or three other relevant situations of vari­
ous intensities, I gradually arrive at a genuine perception
of what awaits me in the future and hence-at a real
experiencing of the hopelessness and tragedy of my po­
sition. The juxtaposition of the details of the first imag­
ined situation produces one shade of this feeling. The
juxtaposition of the details of the second situation-an­
other. Nuance of feeling is added to nuance of -feeling,
and from all these the image of hopelessness begins to
arise, linked inseparably with the sharp emotional expe­
rience of actually feeling such hopelessness.
   In this way, without straining to act the feeling itself,
it is successfully evoked by the assembly and juxtaposi­
tion of deliberately selected details an� situations from
all those that first crowded into the imagination.
   It is quite irrelevant here whether the description of
this process, as I have outlined it above, tallies or not in
its mechanical details with that laid down by this or the
other existing school of acting technique. Here the im­
portant matter to be settled is that a stage similar to that
                  WORD AND IMAGE                        43
which I have described exists on every path to the shap­
ing and intensification of emotion, whether in real life
or in the technique of the creative process. We can con ...
vince ourselves of this by a minimum of self-observation,
whether in the conditions of creation or'in the circum...
stances of real life.
   Another important matter here is the fact that the
technique of creation recreates a life process, condi­
tioned only by those special circumstances required by
art.
   It should be appreciated, of course, that we have been
dealing not with the entire body of acting technique,
but only with a single link in its system.
   We have, for instance, not touched here at all on the
nature of the imagination itself, particularly the tech­
nique of '\varming" it to the point where it paints the
pictures we wish it to, those demanded by the particular
theme. Lack of space does not allow an examination of
these links, though an analysis of them would only con­
firm the soundness of the assertions made here. For tlie
present we confine ourselves to the point already made,
while keeping in mind that the link we have analyzed
occupies no greater place in the actor's technique than
does montage, among the expressive resources of the
film. Nor can we assume that montage occupies any
lesser place, either.

  The question will be asked, In what way does the
above presentation in the sphere of the actor's inner
techniq� e differ in practice or in principle from that
which we had previously outlined' as the e�sence of film
44                 THE FILM SENSE

montage? The distinction here is in the sphere of appli­
cation and not in essential method .
   . QUI; latter question was how to make the living feel­
ings and experience emerge within the actor.
     The former question was how to evoke for the spec­
tator's feelings an emotionally experienced image.
. : In b<;>th questions the static elements, the given factors
and the devised factors, all in juxtaposition with one an­
other, give birth to a dynamically emerging emotion,
a dynamically emerging image.
     We see this as not in the least different in principle
from the montage process in film: here is the same sharp
concretization of the theme being made perceptible
through determining det�ils, the resulting effect of the
juxtaposition of the details being the evocation of the
feeling itself.
     As for the act:ual ,nature of .these component "visions"
that . appear before the "inner eye" of the actor, their
plastic (or auditory) features are completely homogene­
ous with the characteristics tha� . are typical of the film
shot. The terms · 'i'fragments"
above to these visions were not idly chosen, since the
imagination does. �ot call up completed, ·pictures; b:ut
the decisive and determining properties of these pi9tures.
For if we examine . the crowd of "visions" t:1oted down
almost automatically above, which I honestly tried to
record with the photographic accuracy of a psycholog­
ical document, we shall see that these "visiops." have a
positively film-like order-with camera-angles, set-ups at
various distances, and rich montage material.
                  WORD AND IlVIAGE                      45
   One shot, for example� was chiefly that of a man
turning his back, obviously a composition cut by the
frame-lines of his back rather than of the whole figure.
Two heads with a glassy-eyed and stubborn stare are in
contrast to the lowered eyelashes from under which the
woman of the apartment above me stole sidelong glances
at me-obviously requiring a distinction in the distance
of the camera from the subjects. There are several obvi­
ous close-ups-of the new mat before the door, of the
three envelopes. Or, employing another sense that is just
as much a part of our medium-the sound long-shot of
the whispering visitors in the courtroom, contrasting
with the few coins jingling in my pocket, etc. The men­
tal lens works like this with variety-it enlarges the scale
or diminishes it, adjusting as faithfully as a film camera
to varying frame requirements-advancing or drawing
away the microphone. All that is lacking to turn these
imagined fraglnents into a typical shooting-script is to
set numbers before each of the fragments!
   This example reveals the secret of writing shooting­
scripts with genuine emotion and movement, instead of
a mere sprinkling of a numbing alternation of close-ups,
medium shots, and long-shots!
   The basic validity of the method obtains in both
spheres. The first task is the creative breaking-up of the
theme into determining representations, and then cof!l­
bining these representations with the purpose of bring­
ing to life the initiating i7nage of the the7ne. And the
process whereby this image is perceived is identical with
the original experiencing of the theme of the image's
                       THE FILlY! SENSE

content. Just as inseparable from this intense and genu­
ine experience is the work of the director · in writing his
shooting-script. This is the only way that suggests to
him those decisive representations through which the
whole image of his theme will flash into creative being.
  Herein lies the secret of that emotionally exciting
quality of exposition (as distinguished from the affidavit­
exposition of mere information) of which we spoke
earlier, and which is just as much · a condition of a living
performance by an actor as of living film-making.
  We shall find that a similar crowd of pictures, care­
fully selected and reduced to the extreme laconism of
two or three details, is to be found in the finest examples
of literature.
  Take Pushkin's narrative poem, Poltava-the scene of
Kochubei's execution. In this scene the theme of "Koch­
ubei's end" is expressed with unusual vividness in the
image of "the end of Kochubei's execution." But the
actual image of this end of the execution arises and
grows out of the j uxtaposition of three almost "docu­
mentarily" selected representations of three detail inci­
dents from the episode:
            "Too late," someone then said to them,
            And pointed finger to the field.
            There the fatal scaffold was dismantled,
            A priest in ca.ssock black was praying,
            And onto a wagon was being lifted
            By two cossacks an oaken coffin.    . .14"

  •   In the majority of the following citations from Russian poets   a

translation has been made to preserve the original relation of sense
and line, important to the context. In these translations an effort has

It would be difficult to find a more effective selection
of details to convey the sensation of the image of death
in all its horror, than these from the conclusion of the
execution scene.
   The validity of choosing a realistic method to produce
and achieve an emotional quality can be confirmed by
some very curious examples. Here, for instance, is an­
other scene from Pushkin's Poltava, in which the poet
magically causes the image of a nocturnal flight to rise
before the reader in all its picturesque and emotional
possibilities:
       But no one knew just how or when
       She vanished. A lone fisherman
       In that night heard the clack of horses' hoofs,
                                                    15
       Cossack speech and a woman's whisper.

   Three shots:
   I. Clack of horses' hoofs.

   2. Cossack speech.

   3. A woman's whisper.
   Once more three objectively expressed representa­
tions (in sound!) come together in an emotionally ex­
pressed unifying image, distinct from the perception
of the separate phenomena if encountered apart from
their association with each other. '-[he method is used
solely for the purpose of evoking the necessary emo­
tional experience in the reader. The emotional expe"­
rience only, because the information that Marya has
been made to preserve also the quantities, but the rhyme is ignored.
"Vhenever the quotation serves a more general purpose, a recognized
translation is used.-Editor.
                  THE FILM SENSE

vanished has been given in a previous single line ("She
vanished. A lone fisherman" ) . Having told the reader
that she had vanished, the author wanted to give, him
the experience as well. To achieve this, he turns to mon­
tage. With three details selected from all the elements of
flight, his image of nocturnal flight emerges in montage
fashion, imparting the experience of the action to the
senses.
   To the three sound pictures he adds a fourth picture.
It has the effect of a full stop. To attain this, effect he
chooses his fourth picture from another sense. This last
"close-up" is not in sound", but in sight:
      . . . And eight horseshoes had left their traces
      Over the meadow morning dew. . . .

   Thus Pushkin uses montage in creating the images of
a work of art. But Pushkin uses montage just as skill­
fully when he creates the image of a character, or of an
entire dramatis personae. With a superlative combina­
tion of various aspects (i.e., "camera set-ups") and of
different' elements (i.e., montage pieces of pictorially
represented things, clarified by the framing of the shot)
Pushkin gains astonishing reality in his delineations.
Man, indeed, complete and feeling, emerges from the
pages of Pushkin's poems.
   When Pushkin works with a large quantity of mon­
tage pieces, his use of montage grows more intricate.
Rhythm, constructed with successive long phrases and
phrases as short as a single word, introduces a dynamic
characteristic to the image of the montage construction.
                     WORD AND IM AGE                     49
This rhythm serves to establish the actual temperament
of the character being depicted, giving us a dynamic
characterization of his behavior.
   One can also learn from Pushkin how an orderly suc­
cession in transmitting and disclosing a man's character­
istics and personality can heighten the total value of the
image. An excellent example in this connection is his
description of Peter the Great in Poltava:
      I. . . . And then with highest exaltation
   II.   There sounded, ringing, Peter's voice:
  III.   "To arms, God 'with us ! " From the tent,
 IV.     By crowding favorites surrounded,
   V.    Peter emerges. His eyes
 VI.     Are flashing. His look is terrible.
 VII.    His movements swift. Magnificent he,
VIII.    In all his aspect, wrath divine.
  IX.    He goes. His charger is led him.
   X.    Fiery and docile faithful steed.
  XI.    Scenting the fray's fire
 XII.    It quivers. It turns its eyes aslant
XIII.    And dashes into the fight's dust,
XIV.     Proud of its mighty rider. 16

  The above numbering is . of the poem's lines. Now we
shall write out this same passage again as a shooting­
script, numbering the "shots" as edited by Pushkin:
 I.   And then' with highest exaltation there sounded, ring-
      ing, Peter's voice: "To arms, God with us! "
 2.   From the tent, by crowding favorites surrounded,
 3.   Peter emerges.
 4.   His eyes are flashing.
 s.   His look is terrible.
 6.   HIS movements swift.

 7.  Magnificent he,
 8.  In all his aspect, wrath divine.
 9.  He goes.
10.  His charger is led him.

1 2. Scenting the fray's fire it quivers.
1 3. It turns its eyes aslant
14. And dashes into the fight's dust, proud of its mighty
    rider.

   The number of lines and the number of shots prove
to be identical, fourteen in each case. But there is almost
no internal congruence between the lay-out of the lines
and the lay-out of the shots; such congruence occurs
only twice in the entire fourteen lines: VIII == 8 and
X == I I. Furthermore the �ontent of a shot varies as
much as two complete lines (I, 1 4) and as little as 3-
single word (9).*
   This is very instructive for film-workers, particularly
those specializing in sound.
   Let us examine how Peter is "edited":
   Shots I, 2, 3 contain an excellent example of the sig·,
nificant presentation of ,a 5guie in action. Here three.
degrees, three stages of his appearance, are absolutely
distinct: ( I) Peter is not yet shown, but is introduced
in sound-his voice. ( 2 ) Peter has emerged from the
tent, but he is not yet visible. All we can see is the group
of favorites surrounding his emergence from the tent.
 (3) At last, only in a third stage, is Peter actually seen
as he comes from the tent.
  ,. In Russian   "he goes"   is   a   single word,   idet   (phonetically�
"id-y6t") .
                  WORD AND IM AGE

   These are followed by �fiashing eyes, as the most im­
portant detail in his general appearance (4) . And then­
the whole face (5). Only then his full figure is displayed
 (although very likely cut at the knees by the lower
frame-line of a traveling shot) to show. his movements,
their swiftness and brusqueness. The rhythm of the
movement and the character it illuminates are expressed
"impetuously" by the clash of short phrases. The full
display of the full figure is given only in Shot 7, and
now in a manner beyond the conveyance of information
-vividly, as an image: "Magnificent he." In the follo\v­
ing shot this description is strengthened and heightened:
"In all his aspect, wrath divine." Only in this eighth shot
does Pushkin reveal Peter with the full power of a
plastic representation. This eighth shot, obviously, con­
tains Peter at full height, emphasized by all the resources
of shot composition, with a crown of clouds above him,
with tents and people surrounding him at his feet. After
this broad shot the poet at once returns us to the realm
of movement and action with the single word: "He
goes" (idet) . It would be difficult to seize more vividly
Peter's second decisive characteristic: Peter's stride-the
most important since the "flashing eyes." The laconic
"He goes," completely conveys the feeling of that enor­
mous, elemental, impetuous stride of Peter, who always
mad� such difficulties for his suite in keeping up w�th
him. It was in as masterly a manner that Valentin Serov
seized and impressed that "stride of Peter" in his cele­
brated picture of Peter at the construction of St. Peters...
burg.17,
                      THE FILM SENSE

   ; I believe that the presentation above is a correct film
reading of the passage. In the first place, such an "intro­
duction" of a Pushkin character is generally typical of
his style. Take, for example, another brilliant passage of
exactly the same type of "presentation," that of the' bal­
lerina Istomina in Euge r:e Onegin. * A second proof of
the correctne�s of the above reading is the determination
of the order of the words that, with absolute exactitude,
in turn order the successive appearance of each element,
all of which finally fuse into the imag� of the character,
plastically "revealing" it.
     Shots 2 and 3 would be constructed quite differently
if, instead of:
           . . . From the tent,
           By crowding favorites surrounded,
           Peter emerges.

the text had read:
           . . . Peter emerges,
           By crowding favorit�s surrounded,
           From the tent. . . .

  If the emergence had begun \vith,. instead of leading
up to, Peter, the impression would have been quite dif-

ferent. As Pushkin wrote it, it is a model .of expressive­
ness, achieved by a purely montage method and with
purely montage means. For every instance there is avail­
able a different expressive construction. · But the expres­
sive construction chosen for each instance prescribes
and outlines in advance that "only right arrangement of
    _




the only suitable words," about which Tolstoy wrote
in What Is Art? 19
   The sound of Peter's voice and his words are arranged
with just the same quality of logical succession that per­
vades the pictorial images (see Shot I) . For Pushkin did
not write:
           . . . "To arms, God with us ! "
           Sounded Peter's voice, ringing,
           An d with highest exaltation.

but:
           And then with highest exaltation
           There sounded, ringing, Peter's voice:
           "To arms, God with us!" . . .

  If we, as film-makers, should be faced with the task
of building up the expressiveness of such an exclamation,
we, too, must transmit it so that there is an ordered
succession, re,:ealing first its exaltation, then its ringing
quality, followed by our recognition of tbe voice as
Peter's, and finally, to distinguish the words that this .
exalted, ringing voice of Peter utters: "To arms, God
with us!" It seems clearly evident that in "staging" such
a passage, the solution of the opening could simply be
resolved by hearing first a phrase of exclamation coming
54                            THE FILM SENSE

from the tent, in which the words could not be distin­
guished, but which would already resound the exalted
and ringing qualities which we would later recognize as
characteristic of Peter's voice.
   As we see, this has enormous importance in connec�
tion with the problem of enriching the expressive re­
sources of film.
   The example is a model of the most comple� type of
sound-picture, or audio-visual composition. It seems
amazing that there are those who think it hardly neces­
sary to seek assistance from such media, and that one
can accumulate quite enough experience in the study of
co-ordination of music and action exclusively from the
opera or ballet!
   Pushkin even teaches us how to work so that the pic­
ture shots avoid a mechanical coincidence with the beats
on the music track.
   To consider only the simplest of circumstances-non­
coincidence of the measures (in this case, the poetic
lines ) with the ends, beginnings and lengths of the sepa­
rate plastic pictures. In a rough diagram this would ap­
pear something like this:
                                                          � 1
                 I                 I 31415 I 617 I       I9110 I 11 I 12 1 13 I

  The upper row is occupied by the fourteen lines of
the passage. The lower row-by the fourteen pictures
carried through the lines.
  The diagram indicates their relative distribution
through the passage.
                  WORD AND IMAGE                         55
   This diagram makes it clearly evident what exquisite
contrapuntal writing of sound-picture elements Pushkin
employs to achieve the remarkable results of this poly­
phonic passage of poetry. As we have already noted,
with the exception of VIII == 8 and X == I I, we do not
encounter in the remaining twelve lines a single case of
ideritical correspondence of line and picture.
   i\1oreover picture and line coincide in regard to order
only once: VIII == 8. This cannot be accidental. This
single exact correspondence between the articulations of
the music and the articulations of the pictures marks the
most significant montage-piece in the whole composi­
tion. Of its particular type it is unique: within this
eighth shot the features of Peter are fully developed and
fully revealed and, in addition to this, it is the only line
to employ a pictorial comparison: "In all his' aspect,
wrath divine." We see that this device of coinciding
stress of music with stress of representation is used by
Pushkin for his strongest blow in the passage. This is
exactly what would be done in film by an experienced
editor-as a composer in audio-visual co-ordinations.
   In poetry the carrying-over of a picture-phrase from
one line to another is called "enjambement." In his In­
troduction to Metrics, Zhirmunsky writes:
              .
   When the metrical articulation does not coincide with
the syntactic, there arises the so-called carry-over (en-'
jtmtbement) . . . . The most characteristic sign of a carry­
over is the presence within a line of a syntactic pause more
significant than that at the beginning or end of the given
line . . .' .20
                        THE FILM SENSE

  Or, as one can read in Webster's Dictionary:
EN JAMBEMENT    •   •   •   Continuation of the sense in a phrase
  beyond the end of a verse or couplet, the running over
  of a sentence from one line into another, so that closely
  related words fall in different lines. .       .   .

  A good example of enjambement may be recalled
from Keats' Endymion:
               . . . Thus ended he, and both
  Sat silent: for the maid was very loth
  To answer; feeling . well that breathed words
  Would all be lost, unheard, and vain as swords
  Against the enchased croco dile, or leaps
  Of grasshoppers against the sun. She weeps,
  And wonders; struggles to devise some blame
                                    __




  To put on such a look as would say, Shame
  On   tbis poor weakness!        but, for. all her strife,
  She c�uld as soon have crush'd away the life
  From a sick dove. At length, to break the pause,
  She said with trembling chance: "Is this the cause?" . . .

   Zhirmunsky also speaks of a particular one of the
compositional . interpretations of this type of construc­
tion that is also not without a certain interest for our
audio-visual co-ordinations in film, where the picture
plays the role of syntactical phrase and the musical con­
struction the role of rhythmical articulation:
  Any non-coincidence of the syntactic articulation with
the metrical is an artistically deliberate dissonance, which
reaches its resolution at the point where, after a series of
non-coincidences, the syntactic pause at last coincides with
the bounds of the rhythmic series. 21

      This can be illustrated by an example, this time from
.
    Shelley:
             He ceased, and overcome leant back awhile,                                   II
             Then rising, with a melancholy smile
             Went to a sofa,              II   and lay down,       I r and         slept
             A heavy sleep,          II    and in his dreams he wept
             And muttered some famil�ar name,                        II       and we:
             Wept without shame �n his society.                           .   .   .:tI:



       In Russian poetry "enjambement" takes on particu­
    larly rich forms in the work of Pushkin.
       In French poetry the most consistent use of this tech­
    nique is in the work of Victor Hugo and Andre Chenier,
    although the clearest example that.J have ever found in
    French poetry is in a poem by Alfred de Musset:
      L'antilope aux yeux bleus,                     I   est plus tendre peut-etre
      Que Ie roi des forets;             II         mais Ie lion repond
      Qu'il   n
                  '
                      est pas   antilope, I         et qu'il a nom    II      lion. 22

      "Enjambement" enriches the work of Shakespeare
    and l\1ilton, reappearing with James Thomson, and
    with Keats and Shelley. But of course the most interest­
    ing poet in ihis regard is Milton, who greatly influenced
    Keats and Shelley in their use of this technique.
      He declared his enthusiasm for enjambement in the
    introduction to Paradise Lost:
      . . . true musical delight . . . consists onely in apt Num­
    bers, fit quantity of Syllables, and the sense variously dra\vn
    out from one Verse into another .          23

58                 THE FILM SENSE

   Paradise Lost itself is a first-rate school in which to
study montage and audio-visual relationships. I shall
quote several passages from different parts of it-firstly,
because Pushkin in translation can never succeed in giv­
ing the English or American reader the direct delight
in the peculiarities of his composition obtained by the
Russian reader from such passages as those analyzed
above. This the reader can successfully get from Milton.
And secondly, because I doubt whether many of my
British or American colleagues are in the habit of dip­
ping often into Paradise Lost, although there is much
in it that is very instructive for the film-maker.
   Milton is particularly fine in battle scenes. Here his
personal experience and eye-witness observations are
frequently embodied. Hilaire Belloc justly wrote of
him:
  Everything martial, combining as such things do b oth
sound and multitude, had appealed to Milton since the
Civil Wars. . . . His imagination seized especially upon
the call of its music and the splendour of its colour. . . . 24

   And, consequently, he frequently described the heav­
enly battles with such strongly earthly detail that he
was often the s�bject of serious attacks and reproaches.
   Studying the pages of his poem, and in each individual
case analyzing the determining qualities and expressive
effects of each example, we become extraordinari1y en­
riched in experience of the audio-visual distribution of
images in his sound montage.
   But here are the images themselves:

   As in the Pushkih quotation, here also there proves
to be an identical number of lines and shots. Again as
in Pushkin, there is built up here a contrapuntal design
of non-coincidences between the limits of the represen­
tations and the limits of the rhythmical articulations.

   It would b e possible to find" in .i\1ilton as many such
instructive examples of co-ordination as might be de­
sired.
   The formal outline of a poem usually observes the
form of stanzas internally distributed 3;ccording to met­
rical articulation-in lines. But poetry also provides us
with another outline, which has a powerful advocate in
Mayakovsky. In his "chopped line" the articulation is
carried through not to accord with the limits of the line,
but with the limits of the "shot."
   Mayakovsky does not work in lines:
                     WORD AND IMAGE

            Emptiness. Wing aloft,
            Into the stars carving your way.

  He works in shots:
            Emptiness.
            Wing aloft,
            Into the stars carving your way.·

   Here Mayakovsky cuts his line just as an experienced
film editor would in constructing a typical sequence of
"impact" (the stars-and Yesenin ) . First-the one. Then
-the other. Followed by the impact of one against the
other.
   I. Emptiness (if we were to film this "shot," we

      should take the stars so as to emphasize the void,
      yet at the same time making their presence felt).
  2.   Wing aloft.
  3.  And only in the third shot do we plainly portray
      the contents of the first and second shots in the
      circumstances of impact.
   As we can see, and as could be multiplied by other
instances, Mayakovsky's creation is exceedingly graphic
in this respect of montage. In general, however, in this
direction it is more exciting to turn back to the classics,
because they belong to a period when "montage" in this
sense was not dreamt of. Mayakovsky, after all, belongs
to that period in which montage thinking and montage
                                                            ,
principles had become \videly current in all the border­
arts of literature: in the theater, in the film, in photo­
montage, and so on. Consequently, examples of realistic
  • To Sergei Yesenin. The poem is in memoriam.

montage writing taken from the treasury of our classic
inheritance, where interactions of this nature with bor­
dering spheres (for example, with the film), were either
less, or else entirely non-, existent, are the more pointed
and more interesting and, perhaps, the most instructive.
  However, whether in picture, in sound, or in picture­
sound combinations, whether in the creation of an
image, a situation, or in the "magical" incarnation before
our eyes of the images of the drama tis personae­
whether in Milton or in Mayakovsky-everywhere we
find similarly present this same method of montage.
  What conclusion can be drawn from what has been
said up to this point?
  The conclusion is that there is no inconsistency be­
tween the method whereby the poet writes, the method
whereby the actor forms his creation within hi1nself,
the method whereby the same actor acts his role witbin
the frame of a single shot, and that method whereby his
actions and whole performance, as well as the actions
surrounding him, forming his environment          (or the
whole material of a film) are made to flash in the hands
of the director through the agency of the montage ex­
position and construction of the entire film. At the base
of all these methods lie in equal measure the same vital­
izing human qualities and determining factors that are
inherent in every human being and every vital art.
  No matter how opposed the poles in which each of
these spheres may appear to move, they meet in the final
kinship and unity of a method such as we now perceive
in them.

   These premises place before us with new force the
issue that workers in the art of film should not only
study playwriting and the actor's craft, but must give
equal attention to mastering all the subtleties of montage
creation in all cultures.

MONTAGE has been defined above as:
  Piece A , derived from the elements of the them.e being
developed, and piece B, derived from the same source, in
j uxtaposition give birth to the image in which the thematic
matter is most clearly embodied.

Or:
  RepreseJ1,tation A and representation B must be so selected
from all the possible features within the theme that is being
developed, must be so sought for, that their juxtaposition­
the j uxtaposition of those very ele'fnents an d not of alterna­
                  ,
tive ones-shall evoke in the perception and feelings of the
spectator the most complete image     of the the11ze itself.
  This formulation was presented in this way, without
our limiting ourselves by attempting any determination
of the qualitative degrees of A or of B, or by fixing any
system of measuring A or B. The formulation stands,
but we must develop its qualities and its proportions.

   "F1�om all the possible features within the the7ne that
is being developed." This phrase was not included in the
formulation by chance.
  Granted that the single, unifying image that is deter­
mined by its component parts plays the decisive role in
creative film work, we want to point out at the outset
                              69
70                THE FILM SENSE

of this part of the discussion that the means of expression
can be dravvn from any number of various fields in order
to enrich the image further.
   There should be no arbitrary limits set on the variety
of expressive means that can be drawn upon by the film­
maker. I should think that this has been conclusively
demonstrated by the examples above drawn from Leo­
nardo da Vinci and Milton and Mayakovsky.
   In Leonardo's notes for The Deluge, all its various
elements-those that are purely plastic (the visual ele­
ment), those indicating human behavior (the dramatic
element), and the noise of crashing and crying (the
sound element)-all equally fuse into a single, unifying,
definitive image of a deluge.
   Keeping this in mind, we see that the transition from
silent montage to sound-picture, or audio-visual mon­
tage, changes nothing in principle.
   The conception of montage that has been presented
here encompasses equally the montage of the silent film
and of the sound-film.
   However, this does not mea n that in working with
sound-film, we are not faced with new tasks, new diffi­
 culties, and even entirely new methods.
   On the contrary!
   That is why it is so necessary for us to make a thor­
ough analysis of the nature of audio-visual phenomena.
 Our first question is: Where shall we look for a secure
foundation of experience with which to begin our anal­
ysis?
   As al\vays, the richest source of experience is Man
           S YNCHRONIZATION OF SENSE S                   71
                             �
himself. The study of his behavior and, particularly in
this case, of his methods of perceiving reality and of
forming images of reality will always be our determi­
nant.
   Later in our examination of strictly compositional
que�tions, we shall see that Man and the relations be­
tween his gestures and the intonations of his voice,
which arise from the same emotions, are our models in
determining audio-visual structures, which grow in an
exactly identical way from the governing image. Of this
-later. Until we go into further detail about that par­
allel, this thesis will be sufficient: In selecting the mon­
tage material which is to be fused into this or that par­
ticular image which is to be made manifest, ,ve must
study ourselves.
   We must keep sharp notice of the means �nd the
elements through which the image forms itself in our
conSCIousness.
   'Our first and most spontaneous perceptions are often
our most valuable ones, because these sharp, fresh, lively
impressions invariably derive fro712 the 11'lOst widely
various fields.
  Therefore, in approaching the classics, it is useful to
examine not only finished works, but also those sketches
and notes in which the artist endeavored to set down
his first vivid and immediate impressions.
   F or this reason a sketch is often more alive than the
resulting finished canvas-a fact noted by Byron in his
criticism of a fellow-poet:
72                 THE FILM SENSE

         Campb�ll smells too much of the oil: he is never
satisfied "\vith what he does; his finest things have been
spoiled by over-palish-the sharpness of the outline is worn
off. Like paintings, poems may be too highly finished. The
great art is effect, no matter how produced. 3

   Leonardo's The Deluge was not a sketch in the sense
of a "sketch from life," but certainly a sketch in which
he strove to jot down all those features of the image as
it passed before his inner eye. This accounts for the
profusion in his description not only of graphic and
plastic elements, but also of sound and dramatic ele­
ments.
   Let us examine another, sketch, containing all the "pal­
pitation" of our first, immediate impressions.
   This is from the Goncourt Journals-a footnote to the
entry of September 1 8, 1 8 67 :
  I find a description of the Atbletic Arena in the notebook
for our future novels, which haven't been realized, alas !
  . . . In the deep shadow of the two ends of the hall, the
scintillation of the buttons and sword hilts of the policemen.
   The glistening limbs of wrestlers darting into the full
light.-Challenging eyes.-Hands slapping flesh in coming
to grips.-Sweat smelling of the wild beast.-Paleness blend­
ing with blonde moustaches.-Bruised flesh gro"\ving pink.­
Backs sweating like the stone ,valls of a stean1-bath.-Ad­
vancing by dragging on their knees.-Whirling on their
heads, etc. etc.4

   The scene has been brought close to us by a combina­
tion of well-chosen "close-ups," and by the unusually
tangible image rising from their juxtaposition. But what
is most remarkable about it? It is that in these few lines
                SYNCHRONI ZATION OF SENSES                 73

of description the different shots-the "montage ele­
ments" -touch literally every sense-except perhaps that
of taste, which is, however, present in implication:
I. The sense of touch (backs sweating like the stone walls
      of a steam-bath)
2. The sense of S1nell (sweat smelling of the wild b east)
3. The s�nse of sight, including both
   light (the deep shadow, and the glistening limbs of wres­
      tlers darting into the full light; the buttons and sword
      hilts of the policemen gleaming in the deep shadow)
      and
   color (paleness blending with blonde moustaches, bruised
      flesh growing pink)
4. The sense of hearing (hands slapping flesh)
5. The sense of movement (advancing on knees, whirling
   on their heads)
6. Pure emotion, or drama (challenging eyes)

    Countless examples of this kind could be cited, but all
would illustrate, to a greater or a lesser degree, the thesis
presented above, namely:
   There is no fundamental difference in the approaches
to be made to the problems of purely visual montage
and to a montage that links different spheres of feeling
-particularly the visual image with the sound image, in
the process of creating a single, unifying sound-picture
lffiage.
    As a principle this was known to us as far back as
1 92 8 when Pudovkin, Alexandrov and I issued our
"Statement" on the sound-film.:II:
    But a principle is no more than a principle, while our

74                 THE F ILM SENSE

present urgent task is to find the correct approach to
this new kind of montage.
  My search for this approach has been closely linked
with the production of Alexander Nevsky . And this
new kind of montage, associated with this film, I have
named:
  vertical montage.
   What are the origins of this term-and why this par,.,
ticular term?

   Everyone is familiar �ith the appearance of an orches...
tral score. There are several staffs, each containing the
part for one instrument or a group of like instruments.
Each part is developed horizontally. But the vertical
structure plays no less important a role, interrelating as
it does all the elements of the orchestra within each
given unit of time. Through the progression of the ver­
tical line, pervading the entire orchestra, and interwoven
horizontally, the intricate harmonic musical movement
of the whole orchestra moves forward.
   When we turn from this image of the orchestral score
to that of the audio-visual score, we find it necessary to
add a new part to the instrumental parts: this new part
is a "staff" of visuals, succeeding each other and corre­
sponding, according to their own laws, with the move­
ment of the music-and vice versa.
   This correspondence, or relationship, could be just as
succ essfully described if, for the image of the orchestral
score, we had substituted the montage structure of the
silent film.
                S YN CHRONIZATION OF SENSE S                75
   In order to do this, we will have· to draw from our
silent film experience an example of polyphonic mon­
tage, where shot is linked to shot not merely through
one indication-movement, or light values, or stage in
the exposition of the plot, or the like-but through a
simultaneous advance of a multiple series of . lines, each
maintaining an independent compositional course and
each contributing to the total compositional course of
the sequence.
   Such an example may be found in the montage struc­
ture of the "procession" sequence in Old and New.
   In this sequence the several interdependent lines vir­
tually resemble a ball of vari-colored yarn, with the lines
running through and binding together the entire se­
quence of shots.
   These were the sequence lines:
I.   The line of heat, increasing from shot to shot.

2.   The line of changing · close-ups, mounting in plastic in­
     tensity.

3. The line of mounting ecstasy, shown through the dra-
   matic content of the close�ups.

4. The line of women's "voices" ( faces of the singers) .

5 . The line of men's "voices" ( faGes of the singers) .

6. The line of those who kneel under the passing ikons (in- .
     creasing in tempo) . This counter-current gave move­
     ment to     a   larger counter-stream which was threaded
     through the primary theme-of the bearers of ikons,
     crosses and banners.
                  THE FILM SENSE

7. The line of groveling, uniting both streams in the gen­
   eral movement of the sequence, "from heaven to the
   dust." From the radiant pinnacles of the crosses and
   banners against the sky to the prostrate figures beating
   their heads in the dust. This theme was announced at the
   opening of the sequence with a "key" shot: a s\vift cam­
   era pan downwards from the belfry cross glittering in
   the sky down to the church base froD1 where the pro­
   cession is moving.

   The general course of the montage was an uninter­
rupted interweaving of these diverse themes into one
unified movement. Each montage-piece had a double
responsibility-to build the total line as well as to con­
tinue the movement within each of the contributory
themes.
   Occasionally a montage-piece would contain all the
lines, and sometimes only one or two, excluding the
other lines for a moment; at times one of the themes
would take a necessary step backwards only to make
more effective its two steps forward, while the other
themes proceeded ahead in �qual quantities, and so
forth. But the value of a montage-piece was gauged,
not by one feature alone, but always by the whole series
of features, before its place in the sequence could be
fixed.
   One piece, satisfactory in its intensity for the heat
line, would be out of place in that particular "chorus"
into which it would have fallen if gauged alone by its
intensity. While the dimensions of a close-up face might
fit one place, the face's expression would better suit an­
other place in the sequence. The difficulty of this work
           SYNCHRONI Z ATION OF SENSES                     77
should not surprise anyone, because the process is ex­
actly analogous to the preparation of the most unassum­
ing orchestration. Its chief difficulty was of course that
the work was being done with the far less flexible mate­
rial of film, and · that the amount of variation was limited
by the demands of this particular sequence.
   On the other hand, we must keep in mind that this
polyphonic structure I!lade up of many separate lines
achieves its final fOr111 not alone from the plan for it that
was determined beforehand. This final form depends
just as much on the character of the film sequence (or
complete film) as a complex-a complex composed of
film strips containing photographic i7nages.
   It was exactly this kind of "welding," further com­
plicated (or perhaps further simplified? ) by another
line-the sound-track-that we tried to achieve in Alex­
ander Nevsky, especially in the sequence of the attack­
ing German knights advancing across the ice. Here the
lines of the sky 's tonality-clouded or clear" of the ac­
celerated pace of the riders, of their direction, of the
cutting hack and forth from Russians to knights, of the
faces in close-up and the· total long-shots, the tonal
structure of the music, its themes, its tempi, its rhy thm,
etc.-created a task no less difficult than. that of the silent
sequence above. Many hours went · into the fusing of
these elements into an organic whole.                       ,
   It is naturally helpful that, aside from the individual
elements, the polyphonic structure achieves its total ef­
fect through the composite sensation of all the pieces
as a whole. This "physiognomy" of the finished sequence
                  THE FILM SENSE

is a summation of the individual features and the general
sensation produced by the sequence. On the occasion of
the release of Old and New, I wrote of this quality of
polyphonic montage in relation to the "future" sound­
film.5
   In matching music with the sequence, this general
sensation is a decisive factor, for it is directly linked
with the i711agery perception of the music as well as of
the pictures. This requires constant corrections and ad­
j ustments of the individual features to preserve the im­
portant general effect.
   In order to diagran1 what takes place in vertical mon­
tage, we may visualize it as two lines, keeping in mind
that each of these lines rep-resents a wbole complex of a
many -voiced scoring. The search for correspondence
must proceed from the intention of matching both pic­
ture and music to the general, complex "imagery" pro­
duced by the whole.
   Diagram 2 reveals the new "vertical" factor of inter­
correspondence, which arises the moment that the pieces
of the sound-picture montage -a re connected.
   From the viewpoint of montage structure, we no
longer have a simple horizontal succession of pictures,
but now a new "super-structure" is erected vertically
over the horizontal picture structure .. Piece for piece
these new strips in the "super-structure" differ in length
from those in the picture structure, but, needless to say,
they are equal in total length. Pieces of sound do not fit
into the picture pieces in sequential order, but in simul­
taneous order.

   It is interesting to note that in principle these sound­
picture relationships do not differ from relationships
within music, nor do they differ from relationships
within the structure of silent montage.
   Putting aside for the while our discussion of music
relationships, let us speak first of the solution to the
question of correspondence in silent montage. Here the
effect comes not from the simple s�quence of the film .
strips, but from their actual simultaneity, resulting from
the impression derived from one strip being mentally
superimposed over the following strip. The technique
of "double-exposure" has merely materialized this basic
80                  THE FILM SENSE

phenomenon of cinematic perception. This phenomenon
exists on the higher levels of film structure as well as
on the very threshold of film illusion, for '.'persistence
of vision" from frame to frame of the film strip is what
creates the illusion of film movement. We shall see that
a similar superimposition occurs even at the highest stage
of montage development-audio-visual montage. The
"double-exposed" image is just as inherently character­
istic �f audio-visual montage as it is for all other cine�
matic phenomena.
   Long before we even dreamt of sound, I resorted to
this particular technique when I wanted to create the
effect of sound and music through purely plastic means:
  . . . in Strike ( 1 9 24 ) there- are experiments in this direc­
tion. There is a short sequence showing a meeting of the
strikers under the guise of a casual stroll with an accordion .
   This sequence ended in a shot where w e tried t o create
an aural effect through purely visual means.
  The two tracks of the future - picture and sound - were,
in this instance, bot;\ picture tracks, a double-exposure. In
the first exposure a pond could be seen at the bottom of a
hill, up which were moving towards the camera a throng
of strollers with their accordion. The second exposure was
of the huge accordion in close-up, filling the entire screen
with its moving bellows and its high-lighted keys. This
movement, seen from different angles, over the other con­
tinuous exposure, created the full sensation of a melodic
movement, which drew together the whole sequence.6

  Diagrams I and 2 show how the compositional joining
in a silent film ( I ) is distinguished from that of the
sound-film ( 2 ) . It appears as a diagram of a splice, for

montage is actually a large, developing the11zatic 11zove­
ment, progressing through a continuing diagram of in­
dividual splices.
   The compositional structure of related movements as
indicated by Diagram 2 (A1-B1-CI)· is' familiar in
mUSIC.
   And the laws of compositional movement (A-B­
e) have been evolved in the · practice of the silent [ibn.
   The new problem facing the audio-visual · cinema is to
find a system for co-ordinating A-A I ; Al B I CI ; B-B I ;
C-CI , etc.-a system which will determine the intri­
cate plastic and aural movements of a theme through all
the diverse correspondences of A-AI -B I-B-C-C1 ,
etc. (see diagrams on page 79) .
   Our present problem is to find the key to these newly
discovered vertical splices, A-Ab B-BI' learning to
bring them together and to separate them as rhythmi­
cally as is now possible within the highly developed
medium of music, or within the highly developed me­
dium of visual montage. Both these media of cultural
activity long since learned how to handle the lengths
of AI ' B I , etc.; with complete assurance.
   This leads us to the primary quest�on of finding those
means of establishing the proportions between pictures
and sound, and of perfecting the compasses, rulers,
tools and methods that will make it practicable. This, is
actually a question of finding an inner synchronization
between the tangible picture and the differently per­
ceived sounds. We have already mastered the problem
of physical synchronization, even to the point of detect..

ing the discrepancy of a single frame in the matching
 of lips and speech!
   But this co-ordination is far beyond that external syn­
chronization that matches the boot with its creaking­
we are speaking of a "hidden" inner synchronization in
which the plastic and tonal elements will find complete
fusion.
   To relate these two elements, we find a natural lan­
guage common to both-movement. Plekhanov has said
that all phenomena in the final analysis can be reduced
to movement. lVlovement will reveal all the substrata of
inner synchronization that we wish to establish in due
course. Movement will display to us in a concrete form
the significance and 111etbod of the fusion process. Let
us move from exterior and descriptive matters to matters
of an inner and deeper character.
 .
   The role of movement in this problem of synchroni­
zation is self-evident. Let us examine a number of dif­
ferent · approaches to synchronization in logical order.
These are the A B C's of every sound-cutter, but their
examination is essential.
   The first will be in that sphere of synchronization
properly outside the realm of artistic concern-a purely
factual synchronization: the sound-filming of natural
things (a croaking frog, the mournful chords of a
broken harp, the rattle of wagon wheels over cobble­
stones).
   In this case art begins only at that moment of syn­
chronization when the natural connection bet\veen the
object and its sound is not merely recorded, but is
           SYNCHRONI ZATION OF SENSES                     83
dictated solely by the demands of the expressive work
 In progress.
    In the more rudimentary forms of expression both
 elements (the picture and its sound) will be controlled
 by an identity of rby thm, according to , the content of
the �cene. This is the simplest, easiest and most frequent
 circumstance of audio-visual montage, consisting of
shots cut and edited together to the rhythm of the music
on the parallel sound-track. Whether movement exists
in these shots is not of serious consequence. If movement
happens to be present, the only demand upon it is that
it conform with the rhythm fixed by the parallel track.
    However, it is evident that even on this comparatively
low plane of synchronization there is a possibility for
creating interesting and expressive compositions.
   From these simplest circumstances-simple "metrical"
coincidence of accent (film "scansion" ) -it is possible to
arrange a wide variety of syncopated combinations and
a purely rhythmical "counterpoint" in the controlled

play of off-beats, shot-lengths, echoed and repeated sub­
jects, and so on.
   Which step follows this second level of synchronized
surface movement? It may possibly be one that will en­
able us to show not only rhythmic movement, but
melodic 1noveinent as well.
   Lanz spoke correctly of melody when he said :
  . . . strictly speaking, one does not "hear" a melo dy. We
are able or unable to follow it, which means that we either
have or have not the ability to organize the tones into a
higher unity. .     7
                    THE FILM SENSE

    From all the plastic means of expression at · our disposal
 we can surely find those whose movement harmonizes
 not only with the movement of the rhythmic pattern,
 but also with the movement of the melodic line. We
 already have some idea as to what these means might be,
 but since we are about to ,d eal with this question in full
 detail, we will mention at this point that we can assume
that these elements will probably be drawn basically
 from a "linear" element of plastic art.
    "The higher unity" into which we are capable of
organizing the separate tones of the sound-scale may be
visualized as a line that unites them through movement.
The tonal changes on this line may also be characterized
as movement, no longer as _an intermingling movement,
but as a vibrating movement, whose characteristics we
can perceive as sounds of varying pitch and tone.
    What visual element echoes this new type of "move­
ment" introduced to our discussion by tones? Obviously
it will be an element that also moves in vibrations (al­
though of a differing ·p hysical formation) , and is also
characterized by tones. This visual equivalent is color.
 (In 3: rough analogy pitch can correspond to the play
of light, and tonality to color. )
    Pausing for a moment to recapitulate, we see that we
have demonstrated that synchronization can be "natu­
ral," metric, rhythmic, melodic and tonal.
   Matching of picture and sound may achieve a syn­
chronization that fulfills all these potentialities (although
this is a very rare occurrence) , or it may be built upon
a combination of unlike elements, without attempting to
              SYNCHRONIZATION OF SENSES               85

conceal the resulting dissonance between the aurals and
the visuals. This occurs frequently. When it does, we
explain that the visuals "exist for themselves," that the
music "exists for itself": sound and picture each run on
independently, without uniting in an organic whole., It
is iI11p ortant ' to keep in mind that our conception of
synchronization does not presume consonance. In this
conception full possibilities exist for the play of both
corresponding and non-corresponding "movements,"
but in either circumstance the relationship must be com­
positionally controlled. It is apparent that any one of
these · synchronization approaches may serve as the "lead­
ing," determining factor in the structure, dependent on
the need. Some scenes would require rhythm as a deter­
mining factor, others would be controlled by tone, and
so on.
   But let us turn back to those varying forms, or more
accurately, various fields of synchronization.
   We observe that these varying forms coincide with
those varying forms of silent montage which were es­
tablished in 1 92 8-29, and which we later included in the
program for teaching film direction. *
   At that time these "terms" may have seemed to some
of my colleag�es unnecessarily pedantic or playful anal­
ogies to other media. But even then we pointed out the
importanc� of such an approach to the "future" prob- .
lems of the sound-film. Now this is obviously and con­
cretely a sensible part of our experiments in audio-visual
relation �hips.
  •   See item number 49, Bibliography.
86                THE FILM SENSE

  These forms included "overtonal" montage. This kind
of synchronization has been touched upon, above, in
connection with Old and New. By this perhaps not al­
together exact term, we are to understand an intricate
polyphony, and a perception of the pieces (of both
music and picture) as a wbole. This totality becomes
the factor of perception which synthesizes that original
image towards the final revelation of which all of our
activity has been directed.
  This brings us to the basic and primary matter that
forms the definitive inner synchronization-that between
the image and the meaning of the pieces.
   The circuit is complete. From the same formula that
unites the meaning of the whole piece (whether whole
film or sequence) and the meticulous, cunning selection
of the pieces, emerges the image of the theme, true to
its content. Through this fusion, and through that fusion
of the logic of the film's subject with the highest form
in which to cast this subj ect, comes the full revelation
of the film's meaning.         _




   Such a premise naturally serves as a source and de­
parture for the whole series of varying approaches to
synchronization. For each "different" kind of synchron­
ization is embraced by the organic whole, and embodies
the basic ' image through its own specifically defined
limits.
   Let us begin our investigation in the field of color,
not only because color is the most immediate and stim­
ulating problem of the film today, but chiefly because
color has long been (and still is ) used in deciding the
          SYNcHRON IZAT ION OF S E N S E S            87
question of pictorial and aurr! correspondence, whether
absolute or relative and as an indication of specific hu­
                   -




man emotions. This would certainly he of cardinal im­
portance to the problems and principles of the audio­
visual image. The most graphic and effective develop­
ment of a method of investigation would be in the field
of melodic syncbronization for the convenience of
graphic analysis and our primary field of black and
white reproduction.
   So we first turn to the question of associating music
with color, which will lead us in turn to consideration
of that form of montage which may be called chromo­
phonic, or color-sound montage.

  To remove the barriers between sight and sound, be­
tween the seen world and the heard world! To bring
about a unity and a harmonious relationship between
these two opposite spheres. What an absorbing task!
The Greeks and Diderot, Wagner and Scriabin-who
has not dreamt of this ideal? Is there anyone who has
made no attempt to realize this dream? Our survey of
dreams cannot begin here, however.
  Our survey must lead us to some method of fusing
sound with sight, to some investigation of the prelimi­
nary indications leading towards this fusion.
  We will begin by observing the forms taken by these.
dreams of a picture and sound fusion that have disturbed
mankind for so long. Color has always received more
than an average share of these dreams.
  The 'first example is not too remote, drawn from no
88                  THE FILM SENS�

further back than the borderline between the eighteenth
and the nineteenth centuries. But it is a very graphic
example. We first give the floor to Karl von Eckartshau­
sen, author of Disclosures of )\1agic fr011l Tested Expe­
riences of Occult Philosophic Sciences and Veiled Se­
crets of lVature:8
  I have long tried to determine the harmony of all sense
impressions, to make it manifest and perceptible.
  To this end I improved the ocular music invented by
Pere Castel. 9
  I constructed this machine in all its perfection, so that
whole color chords can be produced,· just like tonal chords.
Here is the description of this instrument.
  I had cylindrical glasses, about half an inch in diameter,
made, of equal size, and filled them with diluted chemical
colors. I arranged these glasses like the ·keys of a clavichord,
placing the shades of color like the notes. Behind these
glasses I placed little lobes of brass, \vhich covered the
glasses so that no color could be seen. These lobes \vere
connected by wires with the keyboard of the clavichord, so
that the lobe was lifted when a key was struck, rendering
the color visible. Just as a note d�es away when the finger is
removed from a key, so the color disappears, since the
metal lobe drops quickly because of its weight, covering the
color. The clavichord is illuminated from behind by wax
candles. The beauty of the colors is indescribable, surpassing
the most splendid jewels. Nor can one . express the visual
impression awakened by the various color chords.

                A THEORY OF OCULAR MUSIC
   Just as tones of music must harmortize with the play­
.wright's words in a melodrama, so must colors likewise cor­
 respond with the words.
                   SYNCHRONIZATION OF SENSES                    89
  I set do\vn an example to make this more understandable.
I wrote a little poem, which I accompany with my color
music. It reads:
WORDS:     Sadly she ttJ)andered, lOfveliest of 711aidens   .
MUSIC:     The notes of a flute, plaintive.
COLOR:     Olive, mixed with pink and white.
WORDS:     •   •   •   in fiowe: ry
lVIUSIC:   Gay, rising tones.
COLOR:     Green, mixed with violet and daisy yellow.
WORDS:     Singing a song, joyful as a lark.
MUSIC:     Soft notes, rising and gently falling in quick succes­
           sion.
COLOR:     Dark blue streaked with scarlet and yellowish-
           green.
WORDS:     And God, in the temple of creation, hears her.
MUSIC:     Maj estic, grand.
COLOR:     A mixture of the most splendid colors-blue, red
           and green-glorified \vith the yellow of the dawn
           and purple-dissolving into soft green and pale yel-
           10\\7.

WORDS:     The sun rises over the 1nountains . . .
MUSIC:     A  maj estic bass, from .\vhich middle tones rise im­
           perceptibly!
COLOR:     Bright yellows, mixed with the color of the dawn-
           dissolving into green and whitish yellow.
WORDS:     And shines upon the violet in the valley
MUSIC:     Softly descending tones.
COLOR:     Violet, alternating with varied greens.
  This should be sufficient to prove that colors also hold
the power of expressing the emotions of the soul.
                    THE FILM SENSE

  If this citation should be thought too unfamiliar, let
us next choose one of the best-known examples-Arthur
Rimbaud's famous "color" sonnet, Voyelles, whose
scheme of color-sound correspondences has disturbed
so many intellects:
Vowels : black A , white E, red I, green U, blue 0,
Someday I shall name the birth from which you rise:
A is a black corset and over it the flies
Boil noisy where the crue1.stench fumes slow,
Shadow-pits; E, candor of mists and canopies,
Shiver of flowers, white kings, spears of the glacial snow:
1,purples, blood spit out, laugh of lips so
Lovely in anger or penitent ecstasies;
U, cycles, divine vibrations of green seas;
The peace of animal pastures, peace of these
Lines printed by alchemy on the great brows of the wise;
0,the great Trumpet strange in its stridencies,
The angel-crossed, the world-crossed silences:
- 0 the Omega, the blue light of the Eyes!
                         ( Translation by Aluriel Rukeyser)

  Rimbaud's scheme occasionally approaches that of
Rene Ghil,to although for the most part these two di­
verge sharply:
ou, ou, oui, iou, OUI         Bruns, noirs, a roux
0,  0, io, oi                 Rouges
a, a, aI, ai                  VermilIons
eu, eu, ieu, eUI, eui         Oranges a ors, verts
U, u, iu, uI, ui              Jaunes, ors, verts
e, e, e, ei, ei               Blancs, a azurs pales
ie, ie, ie, 1, i, � 11        Bleus, a azurs noirs
           SYNC H R O N I ZATION OF S E N S E S           91
   It was after Helmholtz had published the results of
his experiments in correlating the timbres of voices and
instruments 11 that Ghil "perfected" his own chart, in­
troducing not only consonants and instrumental timbres,
but also a whole catalog of emotions, premises and hy­
poth�ses which were to be understood as maintaining an
absolute correspondence.
   In an analysis of romanticism, Max Deutschbein con­
cluded that "syntheses of the various sensations" is one
of the fundamental indications of a romantic work of
art.12
   In complete harmony with this definition is the chart
of correspondences between vowels and colors deter­
mined by A. W. Schlegel (1767-1845):
  A represents the light, clear red (das rote lichthe!le A) ,
and signifies Youth, Friendship and Radiance. I stands for
celestial blue, symbolizing Love and Sinc·erity.
U stands for violet, and 00 is adorned in navy blue.13

  Later in this century another romanticist gave a great
deal o� attention to this problem. Lafcadio Hearn, how­
ever, does not attempt any. "classification," and even
criticizes departures from a spontaneous approach to­
wards such a system, as we can see in his letter of Jnne
14, 1893,1 4 in which he disapproves of John Addington
Symonds' newly published In the Key of Blue.               ,
  But in this same letter, written to his friend, Basil Hall
Chamberlain, he tells him:
  . . . you immediately illustrated the values for me. When
you wrote of "the deep bass" of that green I could see, feel,
                    THE FILM SENSE

smell, taste, and che\v the leaf; it \vas rather bitter in taste,
and dense, and faintly odorous. . . . I have been thinking
of soprano, alto, contralto, tenor, and baritone colours. . . .
   A few days before this he had exploded in a passion­
ate outburst for this cause:
   Recognizing the ugliness of wcrds, however, you must
also recognize their physiognomical beauty . . . . For me
words have colour, form, characte,r; they have faces, parts,
manners, gesticulations; they have moods, humours, eccen­
tricities;-they have tints, tones, personalities. . . .1.5
  Further, in an attack on magazine editors who object
to such a style, he says they claim:
  "The readers do not feel as you do about words. They
can't be supposed to know -that you think the letter A is
blush-crimson, and the letter E pale sky-blue. They can't
be supposed to know that you think KH wears a beard
and a turban; that initial X is a mature Greek with \vrin­
kles. . . . "
  Here Hearn gives his answer to these critics:
  Because people cannot see the colour of words, the tints
of words, the secret ghostly motions of words : -
  Because they cannot hear the whispering of words, the
rustling of the procession of letters, the dream-flutes and
dream-drums which are thinly and weirdly played by
          .                              .
words: -
  Because they cannot perceive the pouting of words, the
fro\vning of \vords and fuming of words, the weeping, the
raging and racketing and rioting of words : -
  Because they are insensible to the phosphorescing of
words, the fragrance of \vords, the noisesomeness of ,vords,

words,-the interchange of values in the gold, the silver,
the brass and the copper of words: -
  I s that any reason why w e should not try to make them
hear, to make them see, to make them feel? . . .
  Elsewhere he speaks of the variability of words:
  Long ago I said that words are like lizards in their power
of changing colour with position.16
  This refinement in Hearn is not accidental. It can be
partially explained by his near-sightedness, which had
sharpened his perceptions in these matters. A fuller ex­
planation lies in his long residence in Japan where the
faculty of finding audio-visual correspondence had been
developed with especial acuteness.        *


   Lafcadio Hearn has brought us to the East. where
audio-visual relationships are not only part of the Chi­
nese educational system, but are actually incorporated
into the code of law. They derive from the principles of
Yang and Yin, upon which is based the entire system
of Chinese world-outlook and philosophy.t According
to Sung tradition this law (bo t'u) was delivered to the
world in the form of a diagram (see page 94), brought
up dripping from the river, in the mouth of a dragon­
horse.17

   Even more interesting than the correspondence be­
tween certain sounds and colors is the analogous reflec­
tion of the artistic tendencies of certain "epochs" in the
structure both of music and painting.
   From the increasing and interesting literature in this
field, first mapped by WolfHin, we choose an article by
the late Rene Guillere on the "jazz age," It n'y a plus
de perspective:
  Formerly the science of esthetics rested content on the
principle of fused elements. In music-on the continuous
             SYNC H RO N I ZA T I O N OF S E N S E S     95
melodic line threaded through harmonic chords; in litera­
ture-on the fusion of a sentence's elements through con­
junctions and transitions; in art-on a continuity of plastic
forms and structures of combinations of these forms.
   Modern esthetics is built upon the disunion of elements,
heightening the contrast of each other: repetition of iden­
tical elements, which serves to strengthen the intensity of
contrast. . .18
         .




  A necessary comment on this opinion is that repetition
may well perform two functions.
  One function is to facilitate the creation of an organic
whole.
  Another function of repetition is to serve as a means
of developing that mounting intensity which Guillere
mentions. We need not seek far for examples of both
these functions. Both may be found in films.
  The first function is found in operation in Potemkin­
in the repetition of "Brothers! ", first occurring on the
quarter-deck before the marines refuse to fire; next not
as a sub-title but as the sequence of the sail-boats that
merge shore and ship, and. last, again as a sub-title,
"Brothers! " when the squadron permits the Potemkin'
to pass unattacked.
   Alexander Nevsky contains an example of the second
function of repetition-mounting intensity. Instead o�
repeating a single measure of the music four times as
written in the score, I multiplied this by three, achiev­
ing twelve exact repeats of the measure. This occurs in
the sequence where the peasant militia cuts into the rear
                   THE FILM SENSE

of the German wedge. The resultant· effect of growing
excitement never fails to win the spectators' approval.
  To continue from Guillen�'s article:
   . . . in the form of jazz, if we look into its musical ele­
ment and into its method of composition-\ve find a typical
expression of this new esthetic.
   Its basic parts: syncopation and a dominance of rhythm.
This cancels out smoothly curving lines-curlicues, phrases
in the form of a lock of curling hair, characteristic of
Massenet, and all slow arabesques. Rhythm is stated by
angle-protruding edge, sharp profile. It has a rigid struc­
                                                         '
ture-firmly constructed. It strives towards plasticity. Jazz
seeks volume of sound, volume of phrase. Classical music
was based on planes (not on volumes) -planes arranged in
layers, planes erected atop_ one another, planes horizontal
and vertical, creating an architecture of truly noble propor­
tions: palaces with terraces, colonnades, flights of monu­
mental steps-all receding into a deep perspective. In j azz
all elements are brought to the foreground. This is an im­
portant law that can be found in painting, in stage design,
in film�, and in poetry of this period. Conventional perspec­
tive, with its fixed focus and its gradual vanishing point has
abdicated.
   In both art and literature creation proceeds through sev­
eral pe,rspectives, simultaneously employed. The order of
the day is intricate synthesis-bringing together vie\vpoints
of an obj ect from below and viewpoints from above.
   Antique perspective presented us with geometrical con­
 cepts of obj ects-as they could be seen only by an idea� eye.
Our perspective shows us obj ects as we see thenl \vith both
 eyes-gropingly. We no longer construct the visual world
with an acute angle, converging on the horizon. We open
    '
 up this angle, pulling representation against us, upon us,
toward us. . . . We take part in this world. That is why
            SYNC H RONIZATION OF S EN S E S                  97
                          -
 \ve are not afr�id to use close-ups in films: to portray a
 man as he sometimes seems to us, out of natural propor­
 tions, suddenly fifty centimeters away from us; \ve are not
 afraid to use metaphors, that leap from the lines of a poem,
 or to allo\v the piercing sound of a trombone  '    to S\VOOp
 out of the orchestra, aggressively.
    In �ntique perspective the planes behaved much like the
 wings of a stage setting-receding in a funnel towards the
 depths where the vista closes on a colonnade or on a mon­
 umental stair-case. Similarly in music the theatre wings
 formed by the double basses, the cellos and the violins are
 shaped in like planes, one after the other, like the stairs of
 a great approach, with the eye carried over terraces
 towards the triumphant sunset of the brasses. In literature
 the same structure dominated the milieu-built in elegant
 promenades from one tree to the next; each character de­
 scribed minutely-from the cO,lor of his hair. .  .   .




     In our new perspective there are no steps, no promenades.
 A man enters his environment-the environment is seen
 through the man. Both function through each other.
     In other \vords, in our new perspective-there is no per-
'spective. Volumes are no longer created through perspec­
  tive ; different intensities, varying color saturations now
 create the volumes. Musical volume is no longer created
 through receding planes, with 'a sound foreground and ap­
 propriate recessions. Its volume is now created by the vol­
  ume of sound. There are no more great canvases painted
 with sound in the manner of theatre backdrops. Jazz is vol­
  ume. It doesn't employ voices with accompaniments, simi­
  lar to figures against a background. Everything works. Each
  instrument performs its solo while participating in the
  whole. The orchestra has even lost its impressionist divisions
  -with all the violins, for instance, playing the same theme
  on harmonic notes to create greater richness of sound.
                   T H E FIL M S E N S E

  In jazz each man plays for himself i n a general ensemble.
The same law applies to art: the background is itself       a
volume. . . .
   The above excerpt is interesting for the picture it
provides of equivalent structures in musical and graphic
arts, particularly that of architecture, although the ques­
tions raised here are chiefly concerned with spatial and
proportional concepts. However, we have only to glance
at a group of cubist paintings to convince ourselves that
what takes place in these paintings has already been
heard in jazz music.
   This relationship is just as evident in the architectural
landscape-classic architecture bearing the same relation
to the classicists in music �omposition as the modern ur­
ban landscape bears to jazz.
   Indeed, �oman squares and villas, Versailles' parks
and terraces could be "prototypes" for the structure of
classical music.
   The modern urban scene, especially that of a large
city at night, is clearly the plastic equivalent of jazz.
Particularly noticeable here is that characteristic pointed
out by Guillere, namely, the absence of perspective.
   All sense of perspective and of realistic depth is
washed away by a nocturnal sea of electric advertising.
Far and near, small (in the foreground) and large (in
the background), soaring aloft and dying away, racing
and circling, bursting and vanishing-these lights tend to
abolish all sense of real space, finally melting into a single
plane of colored light points and neon lines moving over
a surface of black velvet sky. It was thus that people
             SYNC H RON IZAT ION OF SE NSES                                   99
used to picture stars-as glittering nails hammered into
the sky!
   Headlights on speedihg cars, highlights on receding
rails, shimmering reflections on the wet pavements-all
mirrored in puddles that destroy our sens.e of direction
 (which is top? which is bottom?) , supplementing the
mirage above with a n1irage beneath us, and rushing be­
tween these two worlds of electric signs, we see them
no longer on a single plane, but as a system· of theater
wings, suspended in the air, through which the night
flood of traffic lights is streaming.
   This reminds us of another starry sky above and be­
low, for the characters in Gogol's story A Terrible
Revenge, imagined that the world floated down the
Dnieper River between the real starry sky above them
and its reflection in the water.
   The preceding impressions were those of at least one
visitor to the streets of New York during the hours of
evening and night.      *




   Guillere's article gains added inter�st thrpugh its de­
scription, not only of the correspondence between mu­
sical and graphic arts, but also through its presentation
  •   Similar impressions have been recorded by Antoine de Saint
Exupery in describing an aerial encounter ,vith a storm: "Horizon?
There was no longer a horizon. I was in the wings of a theatre clut­
tered up with bits of scenery. Vertical, oblique, horizontal, all of
plane geometry was awhirl. A hundred transversal valleys were
muddled in a jumble of perspectives . ...For a single second, in a
waltzing landscape like this, the flyer had been unable to distinguish
between vertic31 mountainsides and horizontal. planes   .   .   .   .   " ( Wind,

100                THE FILM SENSE


of the idea that these arts, fused together, correspond to
the very i'lJUlge of an epoch and the image of the reason­
ing process of those who are linked to the epoch. Isn't
this picture familiar to us, with that "absence of perspec­
tive," reflecting the lack of historical perspective in a
large part of the world today, or in the image of an
orchestra where each player is on his own, straining to
break up this inorganic whole of many units by taking
an independent course-but bound together in an ensem­
ble only by the iron necessity of a common rhythm?
   It is interesting to note that all the traits mentioned
by Guillere have been encountered before in the course
of art history. Each time these traits reappear in history,
one finds them aspiring -towards a unified whole, -a
higher unity . It is only in periods of decadence in the
arts that this centripetal movement changes to a centri­
fugal movement, hurling apart all unifying tendencies­
tendencies that are incompatible with an epoch that
places an over-emphasis on individualism. We recall
Nietzsche:
   . . . What is the characteristic of all literary decadence?
It is that life no longer resides in the whole. The word gets
the upper hand and jumps out of the sentence, the sentence
stretches too far and obscures the meaning of the page, the
page acquires life at the expense of the whole-the whole
is no longer a whole. . . . The whole has ceased to live
altogether; it is composite, summed up, artificial, an un­
natural product.19
   The fundamental and characteristic feature lies pre­
cisely here and not in separate particulars. Aren't the

Egyptian bas-reliefs valid works even though they vvere
done without a knowledge of linear perspective? Didn't
Durer and Leonardo deliberately make simultaneous use
of several perspectives and several vanishing points when
it suited their purposes. And in his painting of Giovanni
                                *


Arnolfini and his wife/o Jan van Eyck employed fully
three- vanishing points (see illustration on page 102). In
his case this may have been an unconscious method, but
what a wonderful intensity of depth this painting gains
thereby!
   Isn't it perfectly legitimate for Chinese landscape
paintings to avoid leading the eye into a single depth,
stretching out the viewpoint instead along the entire
panorama, so that their mountains and water-falls all
appear to be moving towards us?
    Haven't Japanese prints used super-close;..up. fore­
grounds and effectively disproportionate features In
super-close-up faces?
    One may object that our business has not been to
uncover the tendencies of previous epochs towards
unity, but simply to demonstrate a less important and
merely supplementary diapason in our comparison with
a decadent epoch.
   Where, for example, can we also find in the past such
a degree of simultaneity of viewpoints from above and
below, of mixed vertical and horizontal planes, as we
found when we looked for the examples of "intricate' .
synthesis" above?
  •   In the familiar Last   Supper   the objects on the table have a van­
ishing point at variance with that of the room. The Durer engrav­
ing (page    102)   is typical of his use of double perspective.

   Modern "simultaneous" stage settings have their an­
cestors, too, such as those designed by Yakulov 21 in the
"cubist tradition," cutting through "videly separated lo­
cales of action, cutting interiors through exteriors. Their
exact prototypes can be found in the theater technique
of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, where we
may see designs of single settings that offered the man­
ager a desert, a palace, a hermit's cave, a king's throne­
room, a queen's dressing-room, a sepulcher and various
skies-all for the price of one! Such ingenuity immedi­
ately recalls certain works of Picasso, both in his cubist
and more recent periods, where a face or a figure is
presented from multiple viewpoints, and at varying
stages of an action.
   The copperplate frontispiece to a seventeenth­
century Spanish biography of St. John of the. Cross
shows the saint at the moment he beholds the miracu­
lous appearance of the crucifix. With striking effect,
there is incorporated into the same plate a second vie"v
in perspective of the same crucifix-as seen from the
saint's viewpoint.
   If these examples are too special, then let us turn to
El Greco. He provides an instance for us of an artist's
viewpoint leaping furiously back and forth, fixing on
the same canvas details of a city seen not only from
various points outside the city, but even from vario�s
streets, alleys, and squares!
   All this is done "vith such a full consciousness of his
right to work thus, that he has even recorded, on a map
inserted'into the landscape for this purpose, a description
10 4                   T H E F I L M S EN S E

of this procedure. He probably took this step to avoid
any misunderstanding on the part of people who knew
the city of Toledo too well to see his work except as a
form of capricious "leftism."
  'The painting is his View and Plan of Toledo, finished
some time between 1604 and 1614, and now in Toledo's
Greco Museum. It contains a general view of Toledo
from approximately the distance of a kilometer east­
wards. At the right a young man displays the map of
the city. On this map Greco instructed his son to write
these words:
   It has been necessary to put the Hospital of Don Juan
Tavera in the form of a model [that on the cloud] because
it not only so happened as to 'conceal the Visagra gate, but
thrust up its dome or cupola in, such a manner that it over­
topped the town; once put thus as a model, and removed
from its place, I thought it would sho� the fa9ade before
any other part of it; how the rest of it is related to the town
will be seen on the map. . . .22:11=

   That is why I insist upon including El Greco among
the forefathers of film montage. I'll this particular in­
stance he appears as a forerunner of the. newsreel, for
his "re-editing" is rather more informational here than
in his other View of Toledo (painted in the same pe­
riod) .23 In this latter ,vork he accomplished no less rad­
ical a montage revolution of realistic landscape, but here
it has been done through an emotional tempest, which
has immortalized this painting.

   El Greco brings us back to our principal theme, for
his painting has a precise musical equivalent in one por­
tion of Spain's many-sided folk music. El Greco walks
into our problem of color-sound montage, for it. would
have been impossible for him not to have known this
music-so close is' his painting in spirit to the character­
istics of the so-called cante jondo.             *


   This spiritual kinship (naturally without reference to
cinematography! ) is brought out by Legendre and
Hartmann in the introduction to their monumental cata­
log of El Greco's works.
   They begin by citing Jusepe MartInez' testimony to
the effect that· El Greco often invited musicians to his
home. (1\1artInez criticized such behavior as an "unnec­
essary luxury.") We cannot help imagining that an '
affinity of music to painting would be natural in the
work of an artist who had so personal a love for music.
 •   Or cante   hondo; literally,   "a   deep song."
106                THE FILM SENSE

  Legendre and Hartmann openly declare:
  ... we readily believe tha� El Greco loved the Cante
Jondo, and we shall endeavor to explain how his work rep­
resents in painting the counterpart to that which Cante
londo represents in music. 2 4
   In searching for a description and analysis of cante
jondo, we find the splendid brochure on this subject,
issued anonymously by Manuel de Falla on the occasion
of the cante jon do festival organized at Granada by the
composer and Federico Garcia Lorca.25 This brochure
has been summarized and quoted in J. B. Trend's work
on Falla. After tracing elements of the Byzantine chant,
the Arabian song, and gipsy music in cante jondo . . .
  .. . Falla finds analogies with certain types of melody
found in India and elsewhere in the East. The positions of
the smaller intervals in the scale are not invariable; their
production depends upon the raising or lowering of the
voice due to the expression given to the word which is
being sung . . . ; further, each of the notes susceptible of
alteration is divided and subdiyided, resulting in certain
cases in the alteration of the notes of attack and resolution
of some fragments of the phrase. To this may be added the
porta'lnento of the voice-that manner of singing which pro­
duces the infinite gradations of pitch existing between two
notes, whether next to each other or fa� apart. "Summing
up what has been said, we may affirm, firstly, that in cante
hondo (as equally in the primitive melodies of the East) the
musical scale is the direct consequence of what might be
called the oral scale. . . . Our tempered scale only permits
us to change the functions of one note; while in 'modu­
lation by enharmonism,' properly so-called, that tone is
          SYNC H RO N I ZATION OF SE NSES                107
modified according to the natural necessities of its func­
tions . . . . "
   Another peculiarity of cante hondo is the employment
of a compass which rarely exceeds the limits of a sixth.
"This sixth, of course, is not composed solely of nine semi­
tones as is the case with our tempered scale. By the employ­
ment of the enharmonic genus, there is a considerable in­
crease in the number of tones which the singer can pro­
duce . "
   Thirdly, cante hondo provides examples of the repetition
of the same note-to the point of obsession-frequently ac­
companied by. an appoggiatura from above or below. . . .
   Although gipsy melody is rich in ornamental figures,
these (as in primitive oriental music) are only employed at
determinate moments as lyrical expansion or as passionate
outbursts suggested by the strong emotions described in
the text. "They may be considered, therefore, as extended
vocal inflexions rather than as ornamental figures, although
they assume the latter on being translated into the geomet­
rical intervals of the tempered scale. "
  Legendre and Hartmann leave the reader in no doubt
as to their analogy between cante jondo and El Greco.
  . . . when we contemplate those subtly subdivided "in­
tervals" of color, where the modulations of essentials pro­
long themselves into infinity, these violent viewpoints, these
explosive gestures, these violent contortions which so shock
mediocre and colorless minds-we hear the Cante Jondo of
painting-an expression of Spain and the East-of the Occi­
dent and the Orient. . . .27
  Other Greco scholars, such as Maurice Barres, Meier­
Graefe, Kehrer, Willumsen and others, without actually
referring to music, have nevertheless described in a17nost
108                         T H E FIL M S E N S E

these exact words this effect of Greco's paintings. How
lucky are those who may confirm these impressions with
their own eyes!      =If:


  Unsystematized but very curious evidence on this
question is provided in Yastrebtzev's memoirs of Rimsky­
Korsakov. In the entry for April 8, 1893:
   During the course of the evening the conversation turned
to the question of tonality and Rimsky told how harmonies
in sharps had the personal effect on him of colors, while
harmonies in flats conveyed moods of "greater or lesser de­

flat maj or in the "Egypt" ,scene of Mlada was "deliberately
introduced to convey a feeling of warmth, just as the color
red arouses sensations of heat, while blue and purple suggest
cold lmd darkness. "This is possibly why," he said, "that the
strange tonality (E minor) of Wagner's inspired Prelude of
Das Rheingold always has such a depressing effect on me.
I would have transposed this Prelude in the key of E

 In passing, we should remember James McNeill
Whistler's "color symphonies Harmony in Green and

the problem of achieving such absolute correspondence
is still disturbing many minds, even those of American
film producers. Only a few years ago I came across in
an American magazine quite serious speculations as to
the absolute correspondence of the piccolo's tone to­
yellow!

piccolo, serve us as a bridge to the problems, not of
"non-objective abstractions" but those problems encoun­

COLOR AND MEANING
Forms, colors, densities, odors-what is it   in   me
  that corresponds with them?
                             WALT WHITMAN         1
IN THE preceding section we gave a rather thorough
consideration to that question of finding "absolute" re­
lations between sound and color. For further clarifica­
tion let us examine another problem tangent to this,
namely: the question of "absolute" relations bet\veen
particular emotions and particular colors.
   For variety's sake, let us approach this question less
through "authorities" with their reasonings and opinions,
and more through the living emotions and impressions
that artists have left us in this matter.
   And for convenience' sake, let us confine our ex­
amples to one color tonality. Let us compose our o\vn
"rhapsody in yellow."

   Our first example is an extreme case.
   When we speak. of "inner tonality" and "inner har­
mony of line, form and color," we have in mind a
harmony with something, a correspondence with S01Jze­
thing. The inner tonality must contribute to the 1neanillg
of an inner feeling. As vague as this feeling may be, in
its turn it is always directed finally to something con-,
crete, which finds an outer expression in colors, lines
and forms.
   Nevertheless, there are those who claim that such an
approach denies the "freedom" of feeling. To counter
                           II3
1 14                THE FILM SENSE

our views and opinions, they propose an aimless, vague,
"absolutely free" inner tonality (der innere Klang),
neither as a direction nor as a means, but as an end in
itself, as the summit of achievement, as finality.
   Such a view of "freedom" only frees us from reason.
This is truly a rare, unique freedom, the only one abso­
lutely attainable among our fascist neighbors.
   A leading exponent and life-long advocate of the
above ideal is the painter Kandinsky-the source of the
first measures of our "rhapsody in yellow."
   The following is an excerpt from "The Yellow
Sound," 2 a theater-composition by Kandinsky, which
concludes the volume entitled Der blaue Reiter-prac          ­


tically a manifesto of the group of this name-and of
considerable influence in the subsequent tendencies of
modern European art.
   This "Yellow Sound" is actually a "program" for a
scenic presentation of its author's feelings regarding the
play of colors as of music, of the play of music as of
colors, of the play of people in-some way or other, and
so on.
   Within its obscurity and bewildering elusiveness one
eventually senses the presence of some mystic "seed"­
although it would be very difficult to arrive at any clear
definition of it. Finally, in the sixth scene, it is revealed,
almost religiously:
  Dull blue background. . . .
  In the center of the stage is a bright yello,,, giant with
a blurred white face and big , round, black eyes. . . .

   He slowly raises his arms alongside his body (palms
down), growing in height as he does so.
   At the fl10ment he attains the full height of the stage,
and his figure resembles a cross, the stage is suddenly dark­
ened. The music is expressive, following th� action on the
stage.
  The contents of this work cannot be satisfactorily
conveyed, due to the total absence of content-as well
as theme.
   The most we can do for the author is to present a
few examples of his feelings, winding around the "yel­
low sounds":
Scene   2.
   The blue haze gradually gives way to the light, \vhich is
completely and harshly white. Upstage a mound, entirely
round, as bright green as possible.
   The background is violet, rather bright.
   The music is harsh, stormy, with constantly recurring
A's and B's and A flats. These individual notes are finally
swallowed up by the loud tempestuousness. Suddenly total
stillness ensues. A pause. Again A and B moan, complain­
ingly, but definite and sure. This lasts for some time. Then
again a pause.
   At this moment the background suddenly turns dirty
brown. The mound turns dirty green. And at the very
center of the �ound an indefinite black spot is formed,
alternately becoming clearer and then blurry gray. At the
left on the mound a large yellow flower suddenly becomes,
visible. It remotely resembles a big crooked cucun1ber and
constantly grows brighter. Its stem is long and thin. A
single spiny, narrow leaf grovvs out of the middle of the
stem and, is turned toward the side. A long pause.
   Later, in dead silence, the flower very slovvly s\vings
116                   T H E FILM S E N S E

 from right t o left. Still later the leaf joins i n the oscillation,
 but not in unison with the flower. Later still they both
 oscillate in uneven tempo. Then they again swing to and
 fro separately, a very thin B sounding with the motion of
 the flower, and a very deep A with the leaf's motion. Then
 both s\ving in unison, both notes sounding with them. The
 flower trembles violently and is still. The two musical notes
 continue to sound. At the same time many persons enter
 from the left in garish, long, formless clothes (one all in
 blue, another in red, the third in green, etc.-only yellow
 is lacking) . They have very large white flowers in their
hands, similar to the flower on the mound . . . . They speak
a recitative in mixed voices. . . .
    First the whole stage suddenly grows blurred in dull red
light. Secondly, complete darkness alternates with harsh
white light. Thirdly, every�hing suddenly turns a faded
gray (all colors disappear!). Only .the yellow flower shines
ever brighter!
    The orchestra gradually begins and covers the voices.
The music grows restless, falling away from fortissimo to
pianissimo. . . . At the instant that the first figure becomes
visible, the yellow flower trembles as if in a cramp. Then it
suddenly vanishes. Just as suddenly all the white flowers
turn yellow. . . .
    Finally they thro\v a\vay the flowers, which seem to be
soaked in blood, and, forcibly freeing themselves from their
rigidity, run toward the footlights, closely packed shoulder
to shoulder. They often look about them. Sudden darkness.
Scene 3.
  Upstage: two big reddish-brown rocks, one of them
pointed, the other rounded and larger than the first. Back­
ground: black. The giants (of Scene I ) stand between the
rocks and silently whisper to one another. Sometinles they
whisper in pairs, sometimes they approach with all their
heads together. Their bodies remain motionless. In rapid

succession fall from all sides fiarshly colored beams of light
(blue, red, violet, green-alternating several times) . These
beams meet at the center of the stage, where they mix.
Everything is motionless. The giants are almost wholly in­
visible. Suddenly all the colors vanish. The stage is black
for an inst�nt. Then a dull yellow light floods the stage,
gradually growing more intense, until the whole stage is
bathed in garish lemon-yellow. As the light increases, the
music grows deeper and becomes darker and darker (these
movements remind one of a snail forcing itself into its
shell) . During these two movements nothing but light
should be visible on the stage-no obj ects. . . .
Etc., etc.
   The method employed here is clear-to abstract "inner
tonalities" of all "external" matter.
   Such a method consciously attempts to divorce all
formal elements from all content elements; ever.ything
touching theme or subject is dismissed, leaving only
those extreme formal elements that in normal creative
work play only a partial role. (Kandinsky formulates
his theory elsewhere in the volume cited.)
   We cannot deny that compositions of this kind evoke
obscurely disturbing sensations-but no more than this.
   But to this day attempts continue to be made to ar­
range these subjective and largely personal sensations
into meaningful relationships, that are, frankly, just as
vague and remote.      *

   The following will demonstrate how Paul Gauguin
dealt with similar "inner tonalities" in a notebook -en­
titled Genese d'un tableau,3 concerning his painting
"Manao Tupapau-The Spirit of the Dead Watching": 4
   A young Tahitian girl is lying on her belly, revealing a
part of her frightened face. She reposes on a bed covered
with a blue pareo and a light chrome yellow sheet. There
is a background of purple violet, strewn with flowers simi­
lar to electric sparks; a somewhat strange figure stands by
the bed.
   Charmed by a form, a movement, I paint this with no
other concern than to do a nude. As it now stands, it is a
slightly indecent sketch in the nude. What I want to do,
however, is a chaste painting, expressing the Tahitian spirit,
its character and its tradition.
   I use the pareo as a bedspread because it is intimately
bound to the life of a Tahitian. The sheet, with a texture
of tree-bark, must be yellow-because this color suggests
something unexpected to the beholder; and also because it
suggests lamplight which spares me the trouble of produc­
ing this effect. I must have a slightly terrifying background.
Violet is obviously necessary. �he scaffolding of the musi­
cal aspect of the picture is now erected.
   In this somewhat daring pose, \vhat can a young Tahitian
girl be doing stark naked on a bed? Preparing for love?­
This would be characteristic for her, but it is indecent,
and I don't want it. Sleeping? -The act of love \vould be
ended, which is still indecent. I see only fear. What kind
of fear? -<;:ertainly not the fear of some Susanna surprised
by the elders. This fear is unknown in Tahiti.
   The tupapau (Spirit of the Dead) is the answer I am
seeking. It is a source of constant fear for the Tahitians.
At night, a lamp is always kept alight. When there is no
                     COLOR AND MEAN I N G                  1 19

moon, nobody walks along the road without a lantern, and
even then they always walk in groups.
   Having found my tupapau, I become completely attached
to it and make it the motif of my picture. The nude takes
on a secondary importance.
   How does a Tahitian girl · imagine a ghost? She has never
been to the theatre, nor has she read novels, and when she
thinks of a dead person, she can only think of one that she
has already seen. My ghost can only be some little old
woman. She extends her hand as though to clutch her prey.
   A decorative sense leads me to strew flowers over the
background. These are tupapau flowers, phosphorescences,
indicating that the ghost is thinking of you. Tahitian beliefs.
   The title Manao tupapau has two meanings: she can be
thinking of the ghost, or the ghost is thinking about her.
   Summing up. The musical element: undulating horizontal
lines; harmonies of orange and blue woven together by
yellows and violets and their derivatives, all lighted by
greenish sparks. The literary ·Jement: the Spirit of a living
girl bound to the Spirit of the dead. Night and Day.
   This genesis is written for those who always insist on
knowing the whys and wherefores.
   Otherwise, it is simply a Tahitian nude study.
   Here is everything we are seeking: "the scaffolding of
the musical aspect of the picture is now erected;" an ap­
praisal of the psychological values of colors-the "ter­
rifying" use of 'violet, as well as of our yellow, here
calculated to suggest "something unexpected to the be- ,
holder."
   A close associate of Gauguin's has recorded a similar
appraisal of our color. Vincent van Gogh describes his
"Night Cafe" which he has just finished, to his brother:
                5.
1 20               T H E FIL M S E N S E

   In my picture of the "Night Cafe" I have tried to express
the idea that the cafe is a place where one can ruin one's
self, run mad, or commit a crime. So I have tried to express
as it were the powers of darkness in a low drink shop, by
soft Louis XV green and malachite, contrasting with yellow
green and hard blue greens, a nd all this in an atmosphere
like a devil's furnace, of pale sulphur.6
  Here is another artist speaking of yellow-Walther
Bondy, writing of his designs for a production of
Strindberg's Brott oeb Brott 7 in 1 9 1 2 :
   In staging the Strindberg play we made an attempt to
bring the settings and costumes directly into participation
in the action of the play.
   To do this it was necessary for every detail of the milieu
to express something and to play its own specific role. In
many cases, for example, particular colors would be em..
ployed for their direct effect on the spectator. There were
several leit-motifs, conveyed through color, in order to
show a more profound connection between separated mo­
ments of the play. Thus in the third scene (Act II, Scene I )
a yellow motif was introduced into the action. l\1aurice and
Henriette are sitting in the "Auberge des Adrets"; the gen­
eral tone of the scene is black, vvith a black cloth almost
completely covering an enormous stained-glass window;
on the table is a candelabra with three candles. In the neck­
tie and gloves given him by Jeanne, now unvvrapped by
Maurice, the color of yellow appears . for the first time.
Yellow becomes the color motif of Maurice's "sinking into
sin" (through this gift he is inescapably tied to Jeanne and
Adolphe) .
   In the fifth scene (Act III, Scene 2 ) when Adolphe leaves
the stage and Maurice and Henriette become aware of their
crime, great bunches of yellow flowers are brought onto
                COLOR AN D lVI EAN I N G               121

the stage. In the seventh scene (Act IV, Scene I ) Maurice
and Henriette are sitting in the Luxembourg Gardens. The
sky is brilliant yellow, and silhouetted against it are the
thin bare black branches, the bench and the figures of
Maurice and Henriette. . . . It should be noted that the
treatment of the \vhole production was ' on a mystic
plane . . . .

   The premise here is that "particular colors exert spe­
cific influences" on the spectator. This is "substantiated"
by the connection of yellow with sin, and the influence
of this color on the psyche. Mysticism is also men­
tioned. . . .
   It is interesting to see the same associative use made
of this color by T. S. Eliot, particularly in his early
poems:
        Sitting along the bed's edge, where
        You curled the papers from your hair,
        Or clasped the yellow soles of feet
        In the palms of both soiled hands.8
Well! and what if she should die some afternoon,
Afternoon grey and smoky, evening yellow and rose . . .9

The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes,
The yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-
    panes
Licked its tongue into the comers of the evening,
Lingered upon the pools that stand in drains. . . . 1 0
   Mr. Eliot's pointed use of yellow extends even to sub­
stances and objects of this color. In Sweeney Among
the Nightingales:
122                THE FILM SENSE

            ; . . the man with heavy eyes
            Declines the gambit, shows fatigue,

            Leaves the room and reappears
            Outside the window, leaning in,
            Branches of wistaria
            Circumscribe a golden grin. . . .
And Mr. Apollinax ends on:
  I   remember a slice of lemon, and a bitten macaroon.
   To make the color of yellow thoroughly "frighten­
ing" we choose another example.
   There are few writers as acutely sensitive to color as
is Gogo!. And few also are the writers of our time who
understand Gogol as acutely as did the late Andrei
Belyi.
   In his painstaking analysis of Gogol's craftsmanship,ll
Belyi subjects the changes of Gogol's palette throughout
his creative career to the most minute examination in the
chapter, "The Spectrum of Gogo!." What is revealed
thereby? Following the yellow graph in Belyi's charts,
we see our color increasing steadily from the joyous
Evenings in the Village, through Taras Bulha, and mak­
ing its greatest quantitative leap upwards in the second
volume of Dead Souls.
                                           "
   Of all colors employed by Gogol in his first works,
the average of yellow references is only 3 .5 % .
   In the second group (of novels and comedies) this
average rises to 8 . 5 % , and in the third group (Volume I
of Dead Souls) reaches 1 0. 3 % . And lastly (Volume II of
                COLOR A N D M E ANIN G                 123

Dead Souls) , yellow occupies 1 2 .8 % of Gogol's color
attention. Being close to yellow, green moves corre­
spondingly: 8 .6-7 .7- 9 .6-2 1 .6 % . Together, these two
colors occupy more tban · a tbird of Gogol's palette in
his last work.
   Nor does this include the 1 2 . 8 % of "golden" refer­
ences. Belyi points out:
   . . . the gold of Volume II (of Dead Souls) is not the
gold of gold-plate and gold thread, but the gold of cathe­
drals and crosses, heightening the influential role of the
Orthodox Church; the ringing of "gold" is balanced against
the "red ringing" of Cossack glory; with the red graph de­
clining and the yellow and green graphs rising, this second
volume moves a,vay to a color world far removed from
the spectrum of Evenings in the Village . . .
   Even more terrifying seems the "fateful" tone of yel­
low, when we recall how this is exactly the chromatic
scale that dominates another work of art, created in a
tragic twilight-Rembrandt's self-portrait at the age of
fifty-five.12
   To avoid charges of personal prejudice . in describing
the color of this painting, I cite here, not my own, but
Allen's description of this work, as he Wrote of it in his
article relating the problems of esthetics to those of psy­
chology: 13
  . . . the colors are all dark and dull, lightened only in
the center. This center is a combination of dirty green and
yellowed gray, mixed with faded brown; the rest is almost
black . . : .
1 24               T H E FIL M S E N S E

  This yellow . scale, melting into dirty greens and a
faded brown, is emphasized by contrast with the lower
portion of the canvas:
  . . . only below some reddish tones can be seen; muffled
and overlaid upon each other, but, more or less aided by
thickness and their comparatively great color intensity, they
create a clearly expressed contrast to the rest of the paint­
ing.   .   .   .




  In this connection it is impossible to forbear any refer­
ence to the unfortunate image of the aged Rembrandt
presented by Alexander Korda and Charles Laughton in
Rembrandt. As scrupulously costumed and made-up as
Laughton was for these concluding scenes, no attempt
was made to mirror this tragic chromatic scale, so typi­
cal of the late Rembrandt, with an equivalent cinematic
light-scale.
   It becomes apparent that many characteristics we
ascribe to the color yellow derive from its immediate
neighbor in the spectrum-green. Green, on the other
hand, is directly associated 'Yith the symbols of life­
young leaf-shoots, foliage and "greenery" itself-just as
firmly as it is with the symbols of death and decay­
leaf-mold, slime, and the shadows on a dead face.
   There is no limit to the evidence we could bring in
to this court, but have we not enough to make us ask
ourselves, "Perhaps there is something sinister in the na­
ture of the color of yellow? " Does this touch something
more profound than mere conventional symbolism and
habitual or accidental associations?
   For answers to these questions we must turn to the
                COLOR AND M EANIN G                     1 25

history of the evolution o{ symbolic meanings within
certain colors. There is, fortunately, a very thorough
work on this subject by Frederic Portal, first published
in 1 8 5 7 : Des couleurs symboliques dans l' antiquite, Ie
Mo�en-Age, et les tentps modernes.
  This authority on the "symbolic meaning" of color
has this to say about the color that concerns us here­
yellow, and how ideas of perfidy, treason and sin grew
to be connected with it:
   Divine and sacred languages designated with the colors
of gold and yellow the union of the soul with God and, by
opposition, adultery in a spi!itual sense. In profane speech,
this was a materialized emblem representing legitimate love
as well as carnal adultery that breaks the bonds of mar­
rIage. . . .
   The golden apple was, for the Greeks, the sympol of
love and concord and, by opposition, it represented discord
and all the evils in its train; the j udgment of Paris proves
this. Likewise Atalanta, while gathering the golden apples
picked in the Garden of the Hesperides, is beaten in the
race and becomes the victor's prize.14
   Of particular interest is Portal's evidence of one fea­
ture to be found in all mythological matter attaching
to this color: the a71zbivalent meanings that are read into
it. This pheno�enon can be explained by the fact that
in early stages of evolution tbe saute concept, 71zeaning
or word equally represents two opposites tbat are mutu..:.
ally exclusive.
  Yellow, he shows, has equally strong connections with
both "loving union" and "adultery."
  Havel �ck Ellis provides a convincing explanation of
                   T. H E F I L M S E N S E

this phenomenon, that is, in the particular instance of
yellow:
   It ,vas clearly the advent of Christianity that introduced
a new feeling in regard to yellow. . . . In very large meas­
ure, no doubt, this was clearly the outcome of the whole
of the Christian revulsion against the classic world and the
rej ection of everything which stuod as the symbol of j oy
and pride. Red and yellow were the favorite colors of that
world. The love of red was too firmly rooted in human
nature for even Christianity to overcome it altogether, but
yellow was a point of less resistance and here the new re­
ligion triumphed. Yellow became the color of envy.
   Yellow became the color of j ealousy, of envy, of treach­
ery. Judas was painted in yellow garments and in some
countries Jews were compelled to be so dressed. In 'France
in the sixteenth century the doors of traitors and felons
were daubed with yellow. In Spain heretics who recanted
were enj oined to wear a yellow cross as a penance and the
Inquisition required them to appear at public autos de fe
in penitential garments and carrying a yellow candle.
   There is a special reason \vhy Christianity should have
viewed yellow with suspicion. �t had been the color asso­
ciated with wanton love. In the beginning the association
was with legitimate love. . . . But in Greece, and to a still
more marked extent in Rome, the courtezan began to take
advantage of this association.15
  In one of the lectures which I happened to hear given
by the late academician Marr,16 he illustrated the basic
phenomenon of ambivalence with the word-root "kon,"
which is a root for both the Russian word for end,
"kon-yetz," and one of the oldest Russian words for
beginning, "is-kon-i."
                C O L O R AND MEAN I N G                 1 27

   The ancient Hebr ew lan guage contains a similar ex­
ample in the word �i' "Kodcsh," which has both
"holy" and "unholy" significance. The "clean" and "un­
clean" significance of the word tabu is already familiar
to us. And Gauguin has already mentioned that "Manao
tupapau" holds a dual meaning: "she is thinking of the
gbost/' and "the ghost is thinking about her."
   Remaining within the circle of our present interest in
ideas of yellow and gold, we can remark another case
of ambivalence: gold, a symbol of highest value, also
serves as a popular metaphor signifying-filth. This is
true not only in a general way, as in the Western Euro­
pean examples below, but in the Russian language which
contains the term "zolotar" ("zoloto," the root-gold) ,
having the specific meaning of "cess-pool cleaner."
   We will see also that a "positive" interpretation · (in a
"rnaj or key") of this color's golden or yellow gleam
contains a directly sensual base, and that into this are
woven entirely margi,al associations (sun, gold, stars) .
   Even Picasso has remarked these particular associa­
tions:
  There are painters who transform the sun into a yellow
spot but there are others who with the help of their art
and their intelligence transform a yellow spot into a sun.17
  And van Gogh, for whom the color of yellow had
special vitality, casts aside its evil associations which he '
exploited in his "Night Cafe," and takes the floor for
the painters who "transform a yellow spot into a sun":
  . . . instead of trying to reproduce exactly what I have
before my eyes, I use colour arbitrarily so as to express my-

self forcibly. Well, let that be a s far a s theory goes, but I
am going to give you an exampl� of what I mean.
   I should like to paint the portrait of an artist friend, a
man who dreams great dreams, who works . as the night­
ingale sings, because it is his nature. He'll be a fair man.
I want to put into the picture my appreciation, the love I
have for him. So I paint him as he is, as faithfully as I can,
to begin with.
  But the picture is not finished yet. To finish it I am now
going to be the arbitrary colourist. I exaggerate the fairness
of the hair, I come even to orange tones, chromes and pale
lemon-yellow.
  Beyond the head, instead of painting the ordinary wall
of the mean room, I paint infinity, a plain background of
the richest, intensest · blue that I can contrive, and by the
simple combination of the bright head against the rich blue
background, I get a mysterious effect, like a star in the
depths of an azure sky. . . . 18
  The positive source of yellow in the first instance
was the sun (Picasso) , and in the second-a star (van
Gogh) .
  Let us take another image of the golden hue of yellow
-finding it in "a man who dreams great dreams"-Walt
Whitman himself, "speeding through space, speeding
through heaven and the stars":
Painters have painted their swarming groups and the centre­
    figure of all,
From the head of the centre-figure spreading a nimbus of
    gold-color'd light,
But I paint myriads of heads, but paint no head without its
    nimbus of gold-color'd light,
From my hand from the brain of every man and woman
    it streams, effulgently flowing forever.1 9

   Whitman must have loved the color, but loved it
enough not to restrict its application to one use alone.
His nature descriptions are full of a "positive" use of
yellow, growing into great, warm, "positive" land­
scapes:
Sprouts take and accumulate, stand by the curb prolific
    and vital,
Landscapes proj ected masculine, full-sized and golden.20
I see the highlands of Abyssinia,
I see flocks of goats feeding, and see the fig-tree, tamarind,
     date,
And see fields of teff-wheat and places of verdure and
     gold.21
California gets special "golden" attention:
Always California's golden hills and hollows, and the silver
   mountains of New Mexico. . . . 22
The flashing and golden pageant of California,
The sudden and gorgeous drama, the sunny and ample
   lands . . . . 23
    Among the important positive associations that Whit­
man makes with yellow is with a theme that concerned
h ;.� even more than nature-the theme of work:

By the curb toward the edge of the flagging,
A knife-grinder works at his wheel sharpening 4 great,
    knife,
Bending over he carefully holds it to the stone, by foot
    and knee,
With measur'd tread he turns rapidly, as he presses with
    lie-ht ' but firm hand ..

Sparkles from the wheel. 24
and from the Song of the Broad-Axe:
The butter-colored chips flying off in great flakes and

   Despite the powerful major key in which these yellow
references are sounded, there is also a minor key-first
heard in the rural sunset passages, from which the transi­
tion to death and old age stems through direct images:
Ray'd in the limpid yellow slanting sundown,

   But one can detect even among Whitman's broad,
varied uses of this color that he does make some distinc­
tions in his use of subtle differences of sbades of yellow
-ranging all the way from golden to "yellow, all
blanched. "
   Returning to our authority, Portal tells us of a stage
in the evolution of "yellow traditions" in the Middle
Ages. The single color which in antiquity had been a
token of two opposites simultaneously, underwent a
"rationalizing process" and emerged as two distinct
tones, each representing one half of the former double­
significance:
  . . . the Moors differentiated the two symbols by using
two different shades : golden yellow signified wise and
good counsel, and pale yellow signified treachery and de�
celt. . . . 30
  •
132                THE FILM SENSE

The learned rabbis of medieval Spain gave an interpre­
tation of added interest for us:
  . . . the rabbis held that the fruit of the forbidden tree
was a lemon, by opposing its pale color and its acidity to
the golden color and sweetness of the orange or golden
apple, according to the Latin term.
This subdivision is carried further:
  In heraldry, gold is the emblem of love, of constancy
and of wisdom and, by opposition, yellow still denotes, in
our time, inconstancy, j ealousy and adultery.
   Thus came into existence the French tradition men­
tioned by Ellis of smearing yellow paint on the doors
of traitors (such as Charles de Bourbon for his treason
during the reign of Francis I) . The official garment for
an executioner in medieval Spain was prescribed as of
two colors, yellow and red: yellow to symbolize the ac­
cused's treachery; red, retribution.
   These are the "mystic" sources from which the sym­
bolists tried to extract "eternal" color meanings, and
determine the irrevocable influences of colors on the
human psyche.
   But what tenacity there has been in preserving tradi­
tions in this matter !
   It is precisely these meanings that are preserved, for
example, in Parisian "argot"-a language full of wit and
folk imagery.
   Open one of the many dictionaries of this argot to
 the word "jaune":
                   COLOR A N D M E A N I N G                  133

YELLow-the color assigned to deceived husbands : cf. Sa
     f e-rnme Ie peignait en jaune de la tete aux pieds-his
     wife cuckolded him tremendously; un hal jaune-a ball
     where all the men are cuckolds.31
  This is not all. The interpretation of treachery spreads
further than this.
(c) YELLOvV-a member of an anti-socialist trade union.
  This use of the term is to be found in many countries.
We often hear the Second International referred to as
the "yellow international." "Yellow trade unions" is a
familiar term in many places while America knows the
"yellow dog contract. " Yellow as the color of treachery
has been preserved to the point of stigmatizing traitors
to the working class! Through . the medium of films
Alberto Cavalcanti has brought into common usage an
epithet for one of the most despicable of these traitors
-Yellow Caesar. *
   Close cousins of the Paris argot, the slang and "cant"
of America and England have preserved the same asso­
ciations for yellow.
   A New Canting Dictionary of 1 7 2 5 asserts that yel­
low, meaning jealous, \-v as originally a term of the Lon­
don underworld.32
   In Slang and .Its Analogues Past and Present, the
parent of all modern slang dictionaries, the authors
found older, broader interpretations for this color:
YELLO\V, subs. (old colloquial) . ( I ) Generic for j ealousy,

The authors bring Shakespeare to testify:
. . . civil as an orange, and something of that jealous com­
plexion.        (Much A do About Nothing, Act II, Scene I )

   . with a green and yellow melancholy . . .

Her children not her husban d's!
                            ( Whiter's Tale, Act II, Scene 3 )

  American slang is particularly colorful in this respect:
Yello w-livered-Cowardly.
Yellow streak-Cowardice, unc.1ependableness.
Yaller dog-A treacherous person, a cowardly person.34
   Another meaning is found for yellow in the term
"yellow stuff"-money (or, sometimes, counterfeit
money) . A fusion of this meaning and of the more "tra­
ditional" meaning gave birth to that inspired phrase,
formed from "bought" and "treachery"-"the yellow
press."
  However, the most interesting light cast on these
"symbolic meanings" of yellow comes from the fact
that, essentially it was not yellow, as a color, that deter­
mined them.
  We have shown that in antiquity this interpretation
arose as an automatic antipode to the sun-motivated
positive tone of yellow.
                COLOR AND MEANING                        1 35
   Its negative "reputation" in the Middle Ages vvas
formed of the sum of associative and no longer nar­
rowly color indications. The Arabs found "wanness"
rather than "brilliance" in this color. The rabbis saw
yellow as "pallor" rather than as "vividness," and gave
first place to taste associations: the "treacherous" taste
of the lemon as distinct from the sweetness of the
orange!
   This use was also preserved in the argot. There is a
popular French expression rire jaune (yellow laugh­
                              -




ter) . In Balzac's Paris A;larie, Chapter III is entitled "Les
risettes jaunes." Pierre MacOrlan gives the title of
Le Rire Jaune to a novel. The expression can also be
found in the dictionary (Parisisms) quoted above.
What is its meaning?
   An exact counterpart can be found in both the Eng­
lish and Russian languages: a sour smile. (In German
also: ein saures Lacheln. ) The interesting fact here is
that where the French use a color identification, these
other languages use a corresponding designation of taste.
That lemon of the Spanish rabbis   .    furnishes us with a
 key to the code.
    The tradition of dividing the meanings of yellow ac­
 cording to associ�tions was continued oy Goethe. Most
 of his concrete associations are with textures, but he
 introduces a psychological approach with a new pair
 of concepts: "noble" ( edel) and "coarse" (unedel) ,
 which even ring of social motives!
    In Part IV, entitled "Effect of colour with reference
 to moral ' associations/' of Goethe's Farbenlehre, we
 read,:
                    T H E FILM S E N S E


                           YELLOW
   765. This is the colour nearest the light.
   766. In its highest purity it always carries with it the
nature of brightness, and has a serene, gay, softly exciting
character.
   767. In this state, applied to dress, hangings, carpeting,
&c., it is agreeable. Gold in its perfectly unmixed state, es­
pecially when ,the effect of polish is superadded, gives us a
new and high idea of this colour; in like manner, a strong
yellow, as it appears on satin, has a magnificent and noble
effect. . . .
   770. If, however, this colour in its pure and bright state
is agreeable and gladdening, and in its utmost power is
serene and noble, it is, on the other hand, extremely liable
to contamination, and pro�uces a very disagreeable effect
if it is sullied, or in some degree tends to the minus side.
Thus, the colour of sulphur, which inclines to green, has
something unpleasant in it.
   77 I . When a yellow colour is communicated to dull and
coarse surfaces, such as common cloth, felt, or the like, on
which it does not appear with full energy, the disagreeable
effect alluded to is apparent. By a slight and scarcely per­
ceptible change, the beautiful -impression of fire and gold
is transformed into one not undeserving the epithet foul;
and the colour of honour and joy reversed to that of ig­
nominy and aversion. To this impression the yellow hats
of bankrupts and the yellow circles on the mantles of Jews,
may have owed their origin. . . .35
  Before proceeding further on our "yellow path"
(which seems to have landed us among Nazi revivals of
medieval darkness ! ) , let us note some facts about the
color of green, the spectrum neighbor of yellow. The
same picture appears here, too. If green, in its positive
               COLOR AND       MEANING                 137

interpretation, fully coincid�s with the initial image
which is presupposed above, then its "sinister" inter­
pretation is also determined, like the "negative" side of
yellow, not by direct associations, but with the same
ambivalence.
  In its first interpretation, green is a symbol of life,
regeneration, spring, hope. In this the Christian, the
Chinese and the Moslem religions agree. Mohammed is
believed to have been attended in all critical· moments
of his life by "angels in green turbans," and so a green
banner became the Prophet's banner.
  Along with this a number of contradictory interpre­
tations evolved. The color of hope was also the color
of hopelessness and despair: in the Greek theater the
dark green color of the sea conveyed a sinister meaning
under certain conditions.
  This tone of green contains a strong blue. And it is
interesting that in the Japanese theater, where color
symbolism is so "tightly" attached to particular imagery,
blue is the color worn by sinister figures.
  In a letter to me (October 3 I, 1931) Masaru Kobaya­
shi, author of the definitive work on "kumadori" (make­
up in the Kabuki theater) wrote:

  . . .. the basic c9lors employed in kumadori are red and
blue. Red is warm and attractive. Blue, the opposite, is the
color of villains, and among supernatural creatures, the
color of ghosts and fiends. . . .

  And Portal has this to say of green:

  Green, like other colors, had a nefarious meaning; as it
had been the symbol of the soul's regeneration and of wis-
                    THE FILM SENSE


dom, it also signified, by opposition, moral degradation and
madness.
   The Swedish theosophist, Swedenborg, gives green eyes
to the madmen in hell.A window in Chartres Cathedral
depicts the temp-tation.of Jesus-Satan has a green skin and
great green eyes.. .  .




  The eye, in the lore of symbolism, signifies intelligence,
the light of the mind; man may turn it towards good or
evil; Satan and Minerva, folly and wisdom, were both rep­
resented with green eyes.  36

  Abstracting green from green obj ects or the color of
yellow from obj ects of this color, elevating green to an
"eternal green" or yellow to a "symbolic yellow," the
symbolist who performs this feat is remarkably akin
to the madman of whom Diderot wrote to Madame
Volland:
   .. .a single physical quality can lead the mind pre­
occupied with it to an infinite variety of things.Let us take
a color, yellow, for instance: gold is yellow, silk is yellow,
anxiety is yellow, bile is yellow, straw is yellow; with how
many other threads does not this thread connect? Insanity,
dreams, rambling conversations 'consist in passing from one
subject to the next by means of some common quality.
  The madman is unaware of the transition. He holds a
blade of shiny yellow straw in his hand, and he shouts that
he has caught a sunbeam.37

   This madman was an ultra-formalist, seeing as he did
only the for1n of the sunbeam and the y ello7.1J1?ess of the
color, seeing only line and color. And to this color and
line, completely independent of the concrete content of
the object, he gives a meaning, d�termined by himself
alone.
                  COLOR AND MEANING                          1 39
  In this he resembles his ancestor of the period of
magic beliefs. Then, too, meanings were determined for
yellow "of itself."
    The ancient Hindoos performed an elaborate ceremony,
 based on homeopathic magic, for the cure' of j aundice.
 Its mai_n drift was to banish the yellow colour to yellow
 creatures and yellow things, such as the sun, to which it
 properly belongs, and to procure for the patient a healthy
red colour from a living, vigorous source, namely a Ted bull.
With this intention, a priest recited the following spell:
 "Up to the sun shall go thy heart-ache and thy jaundice:
in the colour of the red bull do we envelop thee! We en­
velop thee in red tints, unto long life. May this person go
unscathed and be free of yellow colour ! . .." Then in
order to improve his colour by thoroughly eradicating the
yellow taint, he proceeded thus. He first daubed him from
head to foot with a yellow porridge made of tumeric or
curcuma (a yellow plant), set him on a bed, tied 'three
birds, to wit, a parrot, a thrush, and a yellow wagtail, by
means of a yellow string to the foot of the bed; then pour­
ing water over the patient, he washed off the yellow por­
ridge, and with it no doubt the jaundice, from him to the
birds. . . . The ancients held that if a person suffering from
jaundice looked sharply at a stone-curlew, and the bird
looked steadily at him, he was cured of the disease. "Such
is the creature, " says Plutarch, "and such the temperament
of the creature t�at it draws out and receives the malady
which issues, like a stream, through the eyesight. " . . . The
virtue of the bird lay not in its colour but in its large golden ,
eye, which naturally drew out the yellow j aundice. Pliny
. . . mentions also a stone which was supposed to cure
jaundice because its hue resembled that of a jaundiced skin.
In modern, Greece jaundice goes by the name of the Golden
Disease, and very naturally it can be healed by gold.38
                    THE FILM SENSE


   We must not fall into the error either of the madman
or the Hindu magician, who see the sinister power of
disease or the great power of the sun as solely reposing
in the golden color.
  Ascribing to a color such independent and self-suffi­
cient meanings,
   abstracting color from the concrete pheno111enon,
which was its sole source for the attendant c01nplex of
concepts and associations,
   seeking absolute correlations of color and sound, color
and emotion,
   abstracting the concreteness of color into a system
of colors that act "for their own sakes,"
   we will get nowhere, o! worse, we will arrive at the
same destination as that of the French symbolists of the
latter half of the nineteenth century, about whom
Gorky wrote:
   . . . We must, they tell us, attach to every letter a par­
ticular, specific sensation,-A with cold, 0 with longing,
U with fear, etc. :
colors, as Rimbaud has done, then give them sounds, bring­
ing them to life, making out of each letter a tiny, living
organism. This done, we can begin to combine these into
words. . . . 39
   The harm consequent on such a f!1ethod of playing
with absolute correspondences is self-evident.
  But if vve look more carefully at the schemes for "ab­
solute" relationships cited in the previous section, we
will discover that in almost each citation, its author
speaks not of "absolute correspondences," but of images
                 COLOR AND MEANING


(0 which he has attached personal color concepts. It is
from these various image concepts that the various
"meanings" have evolved, ascribed by these different
authors to the same color.
  Rimbaud begins very decidedly: "A, black; E, white,"
and so on. But in the following line he promises:
Someday I shall name the birth from which you rise.      . . .
And in going further, he does reveal this "secret," not
only the secret of the formation of his own personal
sound-color correspondences, but of the very principle
of any author's determination of such relationships.
  Every vowel, as a result of his personal life and his
private emotional experiences, belongs, for Rimbaud, to
a definite group of image complexes, each of which has
a color source.
   "I" is not merely colored red. But:
          I, purples, blood spit out, laugh of lips so
          Lovely in anger or penitent ecstasies.

     "U" is not merely green. But:
          U, cycles, divine vibrations of green seas;
          The peace of animal pastures, peace of these
          Lines printed by alchemy on the great
            brows of the. wise . . .

(We recall that, according to Lafcadio Hearn, above, a
similar figure, of "a mature Greek with wrinkles," is in- '
dicated by the initial "X," and so on.)
   Here color acts as nothing more than a stimulus, as
in a conditioned reflex, which recalls a whole complex,
                  THE   FILM SENSE


in which it had once played a part, to the memory and
the senses.
  However, one opinion is that Rimbaud's Voyelles was
inspired by his memories of the primer which he had
used as a child. Such primers, familiar to all of us, con­
sist of great letters of the alphabet, next to which ap­
pears the picture of some object or animal whose name
begins with the same letter. Its purpose is to fasten the
letter to the memory through the object or animal.
Rimbaud's "vowels" very possibly grew according to
this "image and likeness." With each letter Rimbaud
associated the "picture" which, for him, was bound to
the letter. These pictures are of various colors, so that
these colors are therefore bound to particular letters.
  This is exactly what takes place with other writers.
  In general the "psychological" interpretation of color
qWl color is a very slippery business. It becomes even
more absurd when this system of interpretation begins
to claim social "associations."
  How gratifying it would be, for example, to find in
the fading colors and powdered wigs of the eighteenth­
century French aristocracy a reflection "so to speak" of
"the ebb of life force from the highest group in the
social structure whose place in history the middle classes
and the third estate are about to assume." How perfectly
this fading scale of delicate (super-delicate!) colors of
aristocratic costumes echoes this formulation! However,
there is a much simpler explanation of this pastel color­
scale: the powder that fell from the wigs onto costumes
that were actually vivid in color. Thus this "scale of
                 COLOR AND MEANING                               1 43
fading colors" penetrates the intelligence, becoming un­
derstood almost as "functional." This is 'protective col­
oration" in significance as much as is khaki; * the fallen
powder is no longer a "dissonance" but is simply un­
noticed.
   The colors of red and white have long been posed as
traditional opposites (and long before the Wars of the
Roses) . Later these colors move in the direction of social
tendencies (along with the representation of divisions in
parliamentary situations as "right" and "left") . Whites
have been the emigres and legitimists in both the Freilch
and Russian Revolutions. Red (the favorite color of
Marx and Zola) is associated with revolution. But �ven
in this case there are "temporary violations. " Towards
the end of the French Revolution, the survivors of the
aristocracy, the most violent representatives of reaction,
started a vogue for wearing red handkerchiefs and cra­
vats. It was als? at this time that the French aristocracy
adopted a hair-dress exposing the nape of the neck. This

Titus, was called "a la Titus," but its actual origin had
nothing to do with Titus, aside from the accidental re­
semblance. Essentially it was a symbol of implacable
counter-revoluti�nary hatred, for it was intended to be
a constant reminder of the shaving of the necks of those
aristocrats condemned to the guillotine. Hence also the'

creating a relic that cried aloud for vengeance to every
sympathetic beholder.
   Thus when any segment of the color spectrum
achieves a special vogue, we can look behind it for the
anecdote, the concrete episode that binds a color to spe­
cifically associated ideas.
   It may be rewarding to recall other color terminology
of pre-revolutionary France-particularly that shade of
brown that enj oyed a vogue at the time of the birth of
one of the last Louis'-that shade that leaves no doubt
as to its origin: "caca Dauphin." A variant of this ,vas
called "caca d'oie." Another self-revealing color-word
is "puce." The popularity among Marie Antoinette's
courtiers of the combination of yellow and red bore
little relation to the Spanish executioner's robes that we
mentioned above. This combination was called "cardinal
sur la pai!le," and was a sign of the French aristocracy's
protest over the imprisonment in the Bastille of Cardinal
de Rohan in connection with the famous case of the
Queen's Necklace.
   In such examples, which are innumerable, lies this
"anecdotal origin" which is at the base of those "special"
interpretations· of color meanings in which so many
authors have indulged themselves. The anecdotes are so
much more graphic and expressive' than the mystic
meanings given these colors!
   Can we, on the basis of all this presented evidence,
deny altogether the existence of relationships between
emotions, timbres, sounds and colors? If not convincing
relationships to all men, can they' at least be established
as common to special groups?

   It would be imp-ossible �to deny such relationships.
Pure statistics themselves would prevent such a mechan­
ical conclusion. Without referring to the special statisti­
cal literature in this field, we can quote again from
Gorky's article:
  .  . It is strange and difficult to understand [Rimbaud's
      _.




attitude], until one remembers the research conducted in
1885 by an eminent oculist among the students of Oxford
University. 526 of these students painted sounds as colors
and vice versa-and they unanimously decided an equiva­
lence between brown and the note of the trombone, be­
tween green and the tone of the hunting-horn. Perhaps
this sonnet by Rimbaud has some psychiatric base.. ..40

   It is clear that in purely "psychiatric" states these phe­
nomena wquld be far more heightened and evident.
   Within these bounds it is possible to speak of t4e con­
nections between certain colors and certain "definite"
emotions. In Havelock Ellis' color investigations he men­
tions certain color predilections established to his satis­
faction:
  . .. in the achromatopsia of the hysterical, as Charcot
showed and as Parinaud has since confirmed, the order.in
which the colors usually disappear is violet, green, blue,
red: . . . this persistence of red vision in the hysterical is
only one instance of a predilection for red \vhich has often
been noted as very marked among the hysterical. 41

   These color reactions of hysterical persons have in�
terested other experimenters, vvhose results concern us
despite the antiquated terminology:
  The experiments of Binet have established that the im­
pressions conveyed to the brain by the sensory nerves ex-
                   THE F I L M S ENSE


ercise an important influence on the species and strength of
the excitation distributed by the brain to the motor nerves.
Many sense-impressions operate enervatingly and inhibi­
tively on the movements; others, on the contrary, make
these more powerful, rapid and active; they are "dyna­
mogenous," or "force-producing." As a feeling of pleasure
is always connected with dynamogeny, or the production
of force, every living thing, therefore, instinctively seeks
for dynamogenous sense-impressions, and avoids enervating
and inhibitive ones. Now, . red is especially dynamogenous.
"When," says Binet, in a report of an experiment on a
female hysterical subj ect who was paralyzed in one half of
her body, "we place a dynamometer in the anaesthetically
insensible right hand of Amelie Cle- the pressure of the
hand amounts to 12 kilogrammes.If at the same time she is
made to look at a red disc, th� number indicating the pres­
sure in kilogrammes is at once doubled. .   .   "
                                                .




   If red is dynamogenous, violet is conversely enervating
and inhibitive. It was not by accident that violet was chosen
by many nations as the exclusive colour for mourning. . . .
The sight of this colour has a depressing effect, and the
unpleasant feeling awakened by it induces dejection in a
sorrowfully-disposed mind.   .   .42 .




   Similar qualities are ascribed by Goethe to· the color
of red. These qualities led him to divide all colors into
active and passive groups (plus and minus). Such a divi­
sion is connected with the popular grouping
                                        .     of "warm"
and "cold" colors.
   When William Blake sought ironical instructions for
his A dvice to the Popes who succeeded the Age of
Rafael,43 he employed such a grouping:

                COLOR AND M EANI NG                     147

   If this data is perhaps insufficient for the formulation
of a convincing "scientific code," nevertheless art has
long since adopted this in a purely empirical manner,
and employed it flawlessly.
   Even though the reactions of a normal person are of
course far less intense than those of Amelie Cle­
while facing a red disc, the artist is quite confident of
the effects he can expect to shape with his palette.
F or the dynamic tempest of his painting of "Peasant
Women," Malyavin 44 didn't just happen to flood his
canvas with a riot of vivid red.
   Goethe has something to say on this score, too. He
divides red into three shades: red, red-yellow and
yellow-red. To this last shade, our orange, he ascribes
an "ability" to exert psychic influence:
                       YELLOW-RED
   775. The active side is here in its highest energy, and it
is not to be wondered at that impetuous, robust, uneducated
men should be especially pleased with this colour. Among
savage nations the inclination for it had been universally
remarked, and when children, left to themselves, begin to
use tints, they never spare vermilion and minium.
   776. In looking steadfast at a perfectly yellow-red sur­
face, the colour seems actually to penetrate the organ. . . .

  As regards our primary interest, the correspondence
of sounds and feelings not only to emotions, but also to
                   THE F I L M SENSE


each other, I had occasion to come upon an interesting
fact outside the scientific or semi-scientific works.
   Its source may not be exactly "legal," but it was direct
and quite logically convincing to me.
   I have an acquaintance, S., to whom I had been intro­
duced by the late Professor Vy-gotsky and by Professor
Luriya.46 S., failing to find any other use for his unusual
faculties, had worked for several years on the vaudeville
stage, astonishing audiences with feats of memory.
While a man of perfectly normal development, he had
retained till his maturity all those traits of primary sen­
sual processes which human beings ordinarily lose in
their evolution of logical thought. In his case, particu­
larly, was that boundless capacity for mentorizing con­
crete obj ects through the visualization of their surround­
ings as well as what is said about them (in the evolution
of the ability to generalize, this early form of thought,
assisted by accumulated single factors, retained by the
memory , becomes atrophied) .
   Thus S. could at the sante tim:e remember any 1lu71ther
of figures or meaninglessly strung together words. He
could then recite these from beginning to end-from end
to beginning-skipping every second or third \vord, and
so on. In addition to this, he would, upon meeting you
a year and a half later, repeat the entire feat, and just as
flawlessly. He could duplicate all the details of any con­
versation that he had ever overheard, and he could recite
from memory all the experiments in \vhich he had taken
part (and the tables used in these experiments often con­
tained several hundred words!) . In short, he was a liv-
                COLOR AND MEANING                        1 49
ing, and naturally more amazing thereby, prototype of
Mr. Memory in Hitchcock's Thirty -Nine Steps. "Eidet­
ics" also figured in his talents-that is,· an ability to make
an exact reproduction, not consciously, but automati­
cally, of any drawing of any complexity (this ability
normally disappears with the evolution of an under­
standing of relationships in drawings or pictures, and of
conscious examination of the obj ects depicted in them) .
   I repeat that aU these traits and abilities were preserved
in S. alongside the absolutely normal traits acquired
through a full development of active consciousness and
of thought processes.
   S. was, of course, endowed far beyond any other
being \vithin my experience, with the power of synes­
thesia, or the production from one sense-impression of
one kind of an associated mental image of a . sense­
impression of another kind. The particular examples of
this cited above were limited to the ability to see sounds
in terms of color and to hear colors as sounds. I once
had an opportunity to discuss this with him. The most
interesting f�ct to appear, for the authenticity of which
I would be glad to vouch, was that the scale of vowels
was seen by him not as colors, but as a scale of varying
light values. Color, for him, is sU112moned only by the
consonants. This seems much more convincing to me
than all the calculations cited above.
   We may say without fear of contradiction that purely
physical relations do exist between sound and color vi­
brations.
   But it, can also be said, just as categorically, that art
                    THE FILM SENSE


has extremely little in comlnon with such purely physi­
cal relationships.
  Even if an absolute correspondence between colors
and sounds were to be revealed to us, such a control
over our making of films would bring us, under the most
perfect conditions, to the same curious destination as
that of the j eweler described by Jean d'Udine:
     I know a goldsmith who, while very intelligent and cul­
  tivated, is certainly a mediocre artist. He is determined to
  design original vases and jewelry at any cost. Beca. use
  empty of genuine creative impulse, he has come to believe
  that all natural forms are beautiful (which, by the way, is
  not true).In order to obtain the purest forms, he is content
  to copy exactly the curves produced by instruments in the
. study of physics, intended for the analysis of natural phe­
  nomena. His principal patterns are the light curves pro­
  duced on a screen by the vibrations on a perpendicular
  plane of the mirror-tipped tuning forks used in physics to
  study the relative complexity of the various musical inter­
  vals. For instance he will copy on a belt buckle the figure
  eight, more or less elegant in contour, produced by two
  forks tuned to the octave. I think it would be difficult to
  convince him that the consonant octave tones which in
  music form a perfectly simple chord do not transmit a com­
  parable emotion through the eye. When he designs a
  brooch by chiseling the particular curve produced by two
  tuning forks sounding at nine intervals from each other, he
  firmly believes that he is creating through plastic art an
  emotion which corresponds to the harmonies that M. De­
  bussy has introduced into the art of music.41

   In art it is not the absolute relationships that are de­
cisive, but those arbitrary relationships within a system
of images dictated by the particular work of art.
               COLOR A N D lVIEAN I N G


  Th� problem is not, nor e�ver will be, solved by a fixed
catalog of color-symbols, but the emotional intelligibil­
ity and function of color will rise from the natural order
of establishing the c olor imagery of the work, coinci­
dental with the process of shaping the living 7novement
of the whole work.
   Even within the limitations of a color-range of black
and white, in which most films are still produced, one
of these tones not -only evades being given a single
"value" as an absolute image, but can even assume abso­
lutely contradictory meanings, dependent only upon the
general sy steln of imagery that has been decided upon
for the particular film.
   It will be enough to note the thematic role played by
the colors of black and white in Old and New and in
Alexander Nevsky. In the former film black was asso­
ciated with everything reactionary, criminal and out­
dated, while white was the color representative of hap­
piness, life, new forms of management.
   In Nevsky, the white robes of the Teuton Ritter were
associated with the themes of cruelty, oppression and
death, while the color of black, attached to the Russian
warriors, conveyed the positive themes of heroism and
patriotism. This deviation from the generally accepted
image for these colors would have been less surprising
to the critics and press abroad (whose objections were
very interesting in themselves) if they had recalled an
astonishing and powerful passage of literature which I
have since found for rnyself-the chapter called "The
Whiteness of the Whale," in Melville's Moby Dick.
                       THE FILM SENSE


  A long time ago * I introduced this subject of i111agery
relationships with color, in analyzing the question of re­
lationships within the montage-image in general.

  If we have even        a   sequence of montage pieces:
                     A   gray old man,
                     A   gray old woman,
                     A   white horse,
                     A   snow-covered roof,
we are still far from certain whether this sequence is work­
ing towards "old age " or towards "whiteness. "
   Such a sequence of film-strips might proceed for some
time before we would finally discover that guiding piece
of film which immediately "identifies" the whole sequence
in one way or another.
   That is why it is advisable to place this "identifying"
piece as near as possible to the beginning of the sequence
 (in an "orthodox" construction). Sometimes it even be­
comes necessary to do this with a sub-title.

  This means that we do not obey some "all-pervading
law" of absolute "meanings" and correspondences be­
                               .
tween colors and sounds-and absolute relations between
these and specific en10tionsj but it does mean that we
ourselves decide which colors and sounds will best serve
the given assignment or emotion as we need the11t.
   Of course, the "generally accepted" interpretation
may serve as an impetus, and an effective one at that,
in the construction of the color-imagery of the drama.
   But the law laid down here will not legalize any abso-

lute correspondence - "in general," but will demand that
consistency in a definite tone-color key, running through
the whole work, must be given by an imagery structure
in strict harmony with the work's theme and idea.

during the performance, so that, in time, I got to
know the sound-the voice, as it were-of each
instrument and the part it filled. . . . Listening
so closely, I also found out for myself the in­
tangible bond between each instrument and true

IN P!\RT II we discussed the new question posed by
audio-visual combinations-that of solving a wholly new
compositional problem. The solution to this composi­
tional problem lies in finding a key to the measured
matching of a strip of music and a strip of picture; such
measured matching as would enable us to unite both
strips "vertically " or shnultaneously: matching each
continuing musical phrase with each phase of the con­
tin\?-ing parallel picture strips-our shots. This will be
conditioned by our adherence to the letter of that law
allowing us to c0111bine "horizontally" or continuously:
shot after shot in the silent film - phrase after phrase of
a developing theme in music. We have brought to this
question an analysis of existing theories on general cor­
relations of aural and visual phenomena. We have also
examined the question of correlating visual and aural
phenomena with specific emotions.
   With these problems in mind we discussed the ques­
tion of correlating music and color. And we concluded
that the existen ce of "absolute" sound-color equiva­
lents-even if found in nature-cannot play a decisive
role in creative work, except in an occasional "supple­
mentary" way.
   The decisive role is played by the hnage structure of
the work, not so much by e'J11ploy ing generally accepted
                            157

correlations, but by establishing in our images of a spe­
cific creative work whatever correlations (of sound and
picture, .sound and color, etc.) are dictated by the idea
and theme of the particular work.
   We turn now from all the preceding general premises
to concrete methods of constructing relations between
music and picture. These methods will not vary basically
no matter how varying the circumstances: it makes no
difference whether the composer writes music for the
"general idea" of a sequence, or for a rough or final
cutting of the sequence; or, if procedure has been or­
ganized in an opposite direction, with the director build­
ing the visual cutting to music that has already been
written and recorded on sound-track.
   I should like to point otit that in Alexander Nevsky
literally all these possible approaches were employed.
There are sequences in which the shots were cut to a
previously recorded music-track. There are sequences
for which the entire piece of music ,vas written to a
                             _




final cutting of the picture. There are sequences that
contain both approaches. There are even sequences that
furnish material for the anecdotists. One such example
occurs in the battle scene where pipes and drums are
played for the victorious Russian soldiers. I couldn't find
a way to explain to Prokofiev what pre,cise
be "seen" in his music for this joyful moment. Seeing
that we were getting nowhere, I ordered some "prop"
instruments constructed, shot these being played (with­
out sound) visually , and projected the results for Proko­
fiev-who almost immediately handed me an exact "mu-

mers which I had shown him�

way, but inversely, completed sections" of the score

       .
neither he nor I had foreseen in advance. Often these
fitted so perfectly into the unified "inner sounding" of
the sequence that now they seem "conceived that way
in advance." Such was the case with the scene of Vaska
and Gavrilo Olexich embracing before leaving for their
posts, as well as a great part of the sequence of knights
galloping to the attack-both of which sequences had
effects that we were totally unprepared for.
   These examples are cited to confirm the statement
that the "method" we are proposing here has been" tested
"backwards and forwards" to check all its possible vari­
ations and nuances.
   What then is this method of building audio-visual
correspondences?
   One answer, a naive one, to this problem would be
to find equivalents to the purely representational ele­
ments in music.
   Such an answer would be not only naive, but childish
and senseless as well, inevitably leading to the confu­
sions of Shershavin in Pavlenko's novel Red Planes Fly
East:
   Out of his wallet he pulled an exercise-book in a peeling

his shoulders. 'C major, B flat major, F flat major are firm,

   Besides such patently absurd definitions as these, any
definitions that even touch this approach of a narrowly
representational comprebension of music inevitably lead
to visualizations of a most platitudinous character-if
for any reason visualizations should be r.equired:
   "Love" : a couple embracing.
   "Illness" : an old woman with a warming pad on her
stomach.
   If we · also add to the pictures evoked by the "Barca­

then? The "illustration" of the lovers and the "illustra­

proaching and receding movements of the water com­
bined with the reflected scampering and retreating play
of light over the surface of the canals, and you immedi­

series of "illustration" fragments, and you are closer to
finding a response to the sensed inner movement of a

   The number of "personal" images arising from this
inner movement is unlimited.
   And they will all reflect this inner movement, for all
                '
will be based upon the same sensation. This even in­
cludes the ingenious embodiment of the Offenbach.
"Barcarolle" in the hands of Walt Disney * where the
visual solution is a peacock whose tail shimmers "musi-

cally," and who looks into the pool to find there the
identical contours of its opalescent tail feathers, shim­
mering upside down.
   All the approachings, recedings, ripples, reflections
and opalescence that came to mind as a suitable essence
to be drawn from the Venetian scenes have been pre­
served by Disney in the same relation to the music's
movement: the spreading tail and its -reflection approach
each other and recede according to the nearoess of the
flourished tail to the pool-the tail feathers are them­
selves waving and shimmering-and so on.
   What is important here is that this imagery in no way
contradicts the "love theme" of the "Barcarolle." Only
here there is a substitution for "pictured" lovers by a
characteristic trait of lovers-an ever-changing opales­
cence of approaches and retreats from one another. In­
stead of a literal picture, this trait afforded a c01nposi­
tional foundation, both for Disney's style of drawing in
this sequence and for the movement of the music.
 · Bach, for example, built his music on this same foun­
dation, eternally searching for those movement means
that gave expression to the fundamental movement
characterizing his theme. In his work on Bach, Albert
Schweitzer provides innumerable musical quotations to
evidence this, including the curious �ircumstance to be
found in the Christmas cantata No. 12 I: 4
  H f)W far he will venture to go in music is shewn in the
Christlnas cantata Ch1'istU112 wir sollen loben schon (no.
12 I). The text of the aria "Johannis freudenvolles Springen
erkannte dich mein Jesu schon " refers to the passage from
          FORM AND       CONTENT:      PRA CTI CE              163

the Gospel of St. Luke, "And, it came to, pass that when
Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in
the womb." Bach's music is simply a long series of violent
convulsions:




   A similar but less willing search 'was confessed by           a

quite different type of composer, Giuseppe Verdi, in             a

letter to Leon Escudier:
   Today I have sent off to Ricordi the last act of Macbeth
finished and complete. . . .
   When you hear it you will observe that I have, written
a fugue for the battle!!! A fugue? I, who detest everything
that smacks of the schools and who have not done such a
thing for nearly thirty years!!! But I'll tell you that in this
instance that musical form is to the point. The r�petition
of subject and counter-subject, the jar of dissonances, the
clashing sounds express a battle well enough.      .   5
                                                       .   .




   Musical and visual imagery are actually not commen­
surable through narrowly "representational" elements. If
one speaks of genuine and profound relations and pro­
portions between the music and the picture, it can only
be in reference to the relations between the funda7J1ental
7J10Ve7J1ents of the music and the picture, i.e., composi­
tional and structural elements, since the relations be­
tween the "pictures," and the "pictures" produced by
the musical images, are usually so individual in percep-
                  THE FILM SENSE


tion and so lacking in concreteness that they cannot
be fitted into any strictly methodological "regulations."
The Bach example is eloquent proof of this.
   We can speak only of what is actually "commensur­
able" i.e., the movement lying at the base of both the
structural law of the given piece of music and the struc­
tural law of the given pictorial representation.
   Here an understanding of the structural laws of the
process and rhythm underlying the stabilization and
development of both provides the only firm foundation
for' establishing a unity between the two.
   This is not only because this understanding of reg­
ulated movement i� "materialized" in equal measure
through the particular specifics of any art, but is 'mainly
because such a structural law is generally the first step
towards the embodiment of a theme through an image
or form of the creative work, regardless of the material
in which the theme is cast.
   This remains clear as long as we deal with theory. But
what happens to this in pract�ce?
   Practice reveals this principle with even greater sim­
plicity and clarity.
   Practice is built somewhat along the following lines:
   We all speak of particular pieces of music as "trans­
parent," or as "dynamic," or as having a "definite pat­
tern," or as having "indistinct outlines."
   We do this because most of us, while hearing music,
visualize some sort of plastic images, vague or clear, con­
crete or abstract, but somehow peculiarly related and
corresponding to our own perceptions of the given
mUSIC.
         FORlYI AND     CONTENT:      PRACTICE          165
   In the more rare circumstance of an abstract rather
than a concrete or a dynamic visualization, someone's
recollection of Gounod is significant. While listening to
a Bach concert, Gounod suddenly and thoughtfully re­
marked, "I find something octagonal in this music. . .    ."


   This observation is less surprising when we remember
that" Gounod's father was "a painter of distinguished
merit" and his mother's mother "a musician and poetess
as well." 6 Both streams of impressions were so vivid
throughout his childhood that he recorded in his mem­
oirs his equally attractive opportunities for working in
the plastic arts as well as in music.
   But in a final analysis such "geometrism" may not be
so exceptional.
   Tolstoy, for example, made Natasha's imagination pic­
ture a much more intricate complex-a complete image
of a man-by means of such a geometrical figure: Nata­
sha describes Pierre Bezukhov to her mother as a "blue
quadrant." 1
   Dickens, another great realist, occasionally shows the
images of his characters by exactly this "geometrical
means," and it is quite likely that in such cases it is only
through such means that the full depth of the character
may be revealed.
   Look at Mr� Gradgrind on the opening page of Hard
 Tinles-a man of paragraphs, figures and facts, fact�,
facts:
  The scene was a plain, bare, monotonous vault of a
school-room, and the speaker's square forefinger emphasized
his observations by underscoring every sentence ,vith a line
on the schoolmaster's sleeve. The emphasis ,vas helped by
166                 THE FILM SENSE


t�e speaker's square wall of a forehead, which had his eye�
brows for its base, ,,,hile his eyes found commodious cellar­
age in two dark caves, overshadowed by the ,vall.. . . The
speaker's obstinate carriage, square coat,. square legs, square
shoulders-nay, his very neckcloth, trained to take him by
the throat with an unaccommodating grasp, like a stubborn
fact, as it was-all helped the emphasis.
  "In this life, we want nothing but Facts, sir; nothing but
Facts! "

  Another illustration of our normal visualization of
music is the ability of each of us, naturally with individ­
ual variations and to a greater or lesser degree of ex­
pressiveness, to "depict" with the movement of our
hands that movement sensed by us in some nuance of
mUSIC.
  The same is true of poetry where rhythm and meter
are sensed by the poet primarily as images of movement.
  How the poet feels about this identification between
meter and movement has been keenly expressed by
Pushkin in his ironic sixth stanza of The Cottage in
Kolomna:
      Pentameters demand caesural rest
      After the second foot, I do agree.
      If not, you oscillate 'twixt ditch and crest.
      Reclining on a sofa though I may be,
      I feel as though a driver with a jag on
      Were jolting ·me o'er cornfields in a wagon. 8

   And it is Push kin who provides some of the best ex­
amples of translating the moven1ent of a phenomenon
into verse.
  For example, the splashing of a wave. The Russian
           FORM AND CONTENT:               PRA CTI CE          167
language lacks a word that adequately and tersely de­
scribes the whole action of a "\vave, rising in a curve and
splashing as it falls. The German language is more fortu­
nate: it has a compound word-wellenschlag-that con­
veys this dynamic picture with absolute accuracy. Some­
where Dumas pere bewails the fact that the French
language compels its authors to write: "the sound of
water striking against the surface," while an English
author has at his disposal the single rich word, "splash."
   However, I doubt if any nation's literature contains a
more brilliant translation of the dynamics of splashing
waves into the movement of poetry than the flood
passage of Pushkin's Bronze Horseman. Following the
well-known couplet,
       Behold Petropol floating lie
       Like Triton in the deep, waist-high!

the flood surges in:
       A siege! the wicked waves, attacking
       Climb thief-like through the windows; backing,
       The boats stern-foremost smite the glass;
       Trays with their soaking wrappage pass;
       And timbers, roofs, and huts all shattered,
       The wares of thrifty traders scattered,
       And the ' pale beggar's chattels small,
       Bridges swept off beneath the squall,
       Coffins from sodden graveyards-all
       Swim in the streets! 9 *
   • Elsewhere I have described the exact "reconstruction" in these

lines of the splashing, the rolling and breaking of a wave, in tenns
that woulo lose their point entirely with any English translation.
1 68                  THE FILM SENSE


   From the material presented above we can formulate
a simple, practical approach to a method of audio-visual
combinations.
   We must know bow to grasp the 1novement of a
given piece of music, locating its path (its line or form)
as our foundation for the plastic composition that is to
correspond to tbe music.
   There are already instances of this approach, building
a plastic composition upon firmly determined musical
lines, in the case of ballet choreography, where there is
a full correspondence between the movement of the
score and of the mise-en-scene.
   However, when we have before us a number of shots
of equal "independence," � at least insofar as their orig­
inal flexibility was concerned, but differing in compo­
sition, we must, keeping the music before us, select and
arrange only those shots that prove their correspond­
ence to the music according to the above conditions.
   A composer must proceed in the same way when he
takes up a previously cut film sequence: he is obliged
to analyze the visual movement both through its over­
all montage construction and the compositional line
carried from individual shot to shot-even the composi­
tions within the shots. He will have to base his musical
imagery composition on these elements .
  ., "Independent" only in the sense that tbematically they can be
arranged i n any sequence. The twelve shots of the "waiting se­
quence" developed below, were precisely of this sort. In their purely
tbematic and narrative-infornlational nature they might h ave been
arranged in a ny order. Their final arrangement was determined by
purely interpretive and emotional requirements of construction.
          FORM AND CONTENT :           PRA CTI CE         169
   The movement which lies at the base of a work of art
is not abstract or isolated from the theme, but is the
generalized plastic embodiment of that image through
which the theme is expressed.
   "Striving upwards," "expanding," '�broken," "well­
knit," "limping," "smoothly developing," "patchy,"
"zig-zagging" -are terms used to define this movement
in the more abstract and generalized instances. We will
see in our example how such a line can contain not only
dynamic characteristics but also a whole complex of
fundamental elements and meanings peculiar to that
theme and that image. Sometimes the primary embodi­
ment of the future image will be found in intonation.
But this won't affect the basic conditions-for intonation
is the movement of the voice flowing from the same
movement of entotion which must serve as a fundamen­
tal factor in outlining the whole image.
   It is precisely this fact that makes it so easy to describe
an intonation with a gesture as well as a movement of
the music itself. From the base of the music's movement
all these manifestations spring with equal force-the in­
tonation of the voice, the gesture, and the movement of
the man who makes the music. Elsewhere we will con­
sider this point in more detail.
   Here we want to emphasize that pure line, that is, the
specifically "graphic" outline of a composition, is only
one of the 'l11any means of visualizing the character of
a movement.
   This, "line" -the path of the movement-under differ-
170               THE FILM SENSE


ing conditions and in differing works of plastic art-can ·
be drawn in other ways besides purely linear ones.
   F or example, movement can be drawn with the same
success by means of changing nuances within the light­
or the color-imagery structure, or by the successive un­
folding of volumes and distances.
   In Rembrandt the "movement line" is described by
the shifting densities of his chiaroscuro.
   Delacroix found this line through that path followed
by the spectator's eye in moving from form to form, as
the forms are distributed throughout the volume of the
painting. He has recorded in his Journal his admiration
for Leonardo's use of "Ie systeme antique du dessin par
boules," 1 0
Delacroix himself used all his life.
   In a remarkably close echo of Delacroix's thoughts on
line and form, Balzac's Frenhofer (in Le Chef-d'ceuvre
Inconnu) says that the human body is not made up of
lines and, strictly speaking, "II n'y a pas de lignes dans
la nature ou tout est plein."
   In opposition to such a view, we can call upon that
"contour" enthusiast-William Blake, whose pathetic
plea,
                                                          .1 1
  o dear Mother outline, of knowledge most sage   .   .



can be found among his bitter polemics against Sir
Joshua Reynolds, and against Sir Joshua's insufficient
regard for the firmness of outline.
  It should be clear that our argument is not over the
fact of movement in the work of art, but over the means
           FORM AND CONTE N T : PRACTICE                         17 1

by which that movement is embodied, which is what
characterizes and distinguishes the work of different
painters.
   In the work of Durer, such movement is often ex,
pressed by the alternation of mathematically precise for�
mu�ae through the proportions within his figures.
   This is not very remote from the expression of other
painters, Michelangelo in particular, whose rhythm
flows dynamically through the undulating and swell­
ing muscles of his figures, serving thus to voice not
only the movement and position of these figures, but
primarily to voice the whole flight of the artist's emo­
tions.*
   Piranesi reveals no less emotional a flight with his
particular line-a line built from the movements and
variations of "counter-volumes" -the broken arcs and
vaults of his Carceri, with their intertwined lines of
movement woven with the lines of his endless stairs­
breaking the accumulated spatial fugue with a linear
fugue.
   Van Gogh similarly expresses the movement of his
line with thick running slashes of color, as though in a
desperate effort to weld the flight of his line with a fly­
ing explosion of color. In his own way he was carrying
out a la\v of Cezanne's which he could not have known
   • We can recall what Gogol said of him : "For Michelangelo, the

body served only as a revelation of the strength of the soul, of its
suffering, of its cry aloud, of its invincible nature-and for him mere
plastics ,vere discarded, and man's contour assumed gigantic propor­
tions in jts function as a symbol; the result is not nlan, but man's
paSSIOns." 1 2
17 2                  THE FILM SE NSE


-a law carried out in an entirely different aspect by
Cezanne himself:
                                                               13
   Le dessin et la eouleur ne sont point distinets

   Moreover, any "communicator" realizes the existence
of such a "line." A practitioner in any medium of com­
munication has to build his line, if not from plastic ele­
ments, then certainly from "dramatic" and thematic
elements.
   In this we must bear in mind that in cinema, the selec­
tion of "correspondences" between picture and lTIusic
must not be satisfied with any one of these "lines," or
even with a harmony of several employed together.
Aside from these general formal elements the same law
has to determine the selection of the right people, the
right faces, the right objects, the right actions, and the
right sequences, out of all the equally possible selections
within the circumstances of a given situation.
  Back in the days of the silent film, we spoke of the
"orchestration" of typage faces * in repeated instances
                              -
(for example, in producing the mounting "line" of
grief by means of intensified close-ups in the sequence
of "mourning for Vakulinchuk" in P otelnkin) .
  Similarly, in sound-films there arise such moments as
that mentioned above: the farewell enlbrace between
Vaska and Gavrilo Olexich in Alexander Nevsky . This
  • Typage, as a term and as a method, might be defined as "type­

casting" (of non-actors) , elevated by Eisenstein to the level of a
conscious creative instrument, just as 11Zontage, a simple term for a
physical process of film editing, has been transformed to a broader
term and a deeper process by the Russian film-m�kers.-Editor.

score, in the same way that the close-up shots of the
German knights' helmets could not be used before the
point where they were finally employed in the attack
sequence, for only at that point does the music change
its character from one that can be expressed in long
shots and medium shots of the attack to one that de­
mands rhythmic visual beats, close-ups of galloping and
the like.
   Alongside this, we cannot deny the fact that the most
striking and immediate impression will be gained, of
course, from a congruence of the movement of the music
with the movement of the visual conto ur with the-




graphic composition of the frame; for this contour or
this outline, or this line is the most vivid "emphasizer"
of the very idea of the movement.
   But let us turn to the object of our analysis and try,
through one fragment from the beginning of Reel 7 of
Alexander Nevsky, to demonstrate how and why a cer­
tain series of shots in a certain order and of a certain
length was related in a specific way, rather than any
other way, with a certain piece of the musical score.
   We will try to discover here that "secret" of those
sequential vertical correspondences which, step by step,
relate the music to the shots tbrougb an identical 11'lotion
that lies at the base of the musical as well as the pictori�l
movement.
   Of particular interest in this case is the fact that the
music was composed to a completely finished editing of
the pictorial element. The visual movement of the theme
1 74              THE FILM SENSE


was fully grasped by the composer to the same degree
                                                     '
that the completed musical movement was caught by
the director in the subsequent scene of the attack, where
the shots were matched to the previously recorded
music-track.
   However, it is an exactly identical method of binding
organically through movement that is used in either case.
Therefore, methodologically, it is absolutely immaterial
from which element the process of determining audio­
visual combinations begins.

   The audio-visual aspect of Alexander Nevsky achieves
its most complete fusion in the sequence of the "Battle
on the Ice"-particularly in the "attack of the knights"
and the "punishment of the knights." This aspect be­
comes a decisive factor also, because of all the sequences
of A)exander Nevsky , the attack seemed the most im­
pressive and memorable to critics and spectators. The
method used in it of audio-visual correspondence is that
used for any sequence in the film. So for our analysis we
will choose a fragment which can be some-vv hat satis­
factorily reproduced on a printed page-some fragment
where a whole complex is resolved by almost 711otionless
frames, in which a minimum would be lost by showing
its shots on a page rather than on a s�reen. It is such a
fragment that we have chosen for analysis.
   These are the twelve shots of that "dawn of anxious
waiting" which precedes the beginning of the attack and
battle, and which follows a night full of trouble and
anxiety, on the eve of the "Battle on the Ice." The

 thematic content of the �-e twelve frames has a simple
 unity: Alexander on Raven Rock and the Russian troops
 at the foot of the Rock on the shore of the frozen Lake
 Chudskoye, peering into the distance from which the
enemy is to appear.
    A diagram inserted in the back of this book shows
   u
fo r divisions. The first two describe the succession of
shot-frames and musical measures which together ex­
press the situation. XII frames; 1 7 measures. (This
particular disposition of the pictures and the measures
will be clarified in the process of analysis; this disposi­
tion is connected with the chief inner components of
music and picture. )
    Let us imagine these XII shots and these 1 7 measures
of music-not as we see them in the diagram, but as we
experienced them from the screen. What part of this
audio-visual continuity exerted the greatest pull on our
attention?
   The strongest impression seems to come from Shot III
followed by Shot IV. We must keep in mind that such
an impression does not come from the photographed
shots alone, but is an audio-visual hnpression which is
created by the combination of these two shots together
with the corresponding music-which is what one expe­
riences in the 'auditorium. These two shots, III and IV,
correspond to these measures of music- 5, 6 and 7, 8 . ,
   That this is the most immediate and most impressive
audio-visual group can be checked by playing the four
measures on the piano "to the accompaniment" of the
reproduced corresponding two shots. This impression
                    THE FILM SENSE


was confirmed in the appraisal of this excerpt during the
students' screening at the State Institute of Cinematog­
raphy.
   Take these four measures and try to describe in the
air with your hand that line of movement suggested by
the movement of the music.
   The first chord can be visualized as a "starting plat­
forln."
   The following five quarter-notes, proceeding in a
scale upwards, would find a natural gesture-visualization
in a tensely rising line. Therefore, instead of describing
this passage with a simple climbing line, we will tend
slightly to arch our corresponding gesture-ah:

ceded by a sharply accented sixteenth, will in these cir­

an arc through the outlined dark cloud, hanging over
the lighter lower part of the sky.
   From b to c-an abrupt fall of the eye downwards:
from the upper frame-line of Shot III almost to the
lower frame-line of Shot IV-the maximum fall possible
in this 'vertical position.
                   THE FILM · SENSE


  From c to d-evenly borizontal-with neither an
ascending nor a descending movement, but twice inter­
rupted by the points of the flags that stand over the
horizontal line of the troops.
  Now let us collate the two graphs. What do we find?
Both graphs of movement correspond absolutely, that is,
we find a complete correspondence between the move­
rnent of tbe music and the movement of the ey e over
the lines of the plastic composition.
  In other words, exactly the same motion lies at the
base of botb the musical and tbe plastic structures.
   I believe that this motion can also be linked with the
emotional movement. The rising tremolo of the cellos
in the scale of C minor clearly accompanies the increas­
ingly tense excitement as well as the increasing atmos­
phere of watching. The chord seems to break this at­
mosphere. The series of eighth-notes seems to describe
the motionless line of the troops: the feelings of the
troops spread along the entire front; a feeling which
grows again in Shot V, with renewed tenseness in Shot
VI.
   It is interesting to note that Shot IV, which corre­
sponds to measures 7 and ' 8, contains two flags, while
the music contains four eighth-notes . . The eye appears
to pass over these two flags twice, so that the front seems
twice as broad as that which we actually see before us
in the frame. Passing from left to right, the eye "taps
01" the eighth-notes with flags, and the two remaining
notes lead the perception away beyond the frame-line to
           FORM AND CONTENT:        PRA CTICE        1 79
the right, where the imagination continues indefinitely
the front-line of the troops.
   Now it becomes clear why these two shots in juxta­
position arrested our attention particularly. The plastic
element of movement and the musical movement coin­
cide here, with a maximum of descriptiveness.
   Let us, however, proceed further, to find what catches
our "second" attention. Running over this sequence
again, we are attracted by Shots I, VI-VII, IX-X.
   Looking more closely at the music with these shots,
we will find a structure similar to the music of Shot III.
 (Generally speaking, the music for this entire fragment
consists, actually, of two two-measure phrases A and
B, alternating with each other in a certain way. The dis­
tinguishing factor here is that while they belong struc­
turally to the same A phrase, they vary in tonality: the
music with Shots I and III belong to one tonality [ C
minor] , while the music of Shots VI-VIII and IX-X
belong to another [C sharp minor] . The relation of this
tonal change to the thematic meaning of the sequence
will be brought out in the analysis of Shot V. )
   Thus the music for Shots I, VI-VII and IX-X will
duplicate the graph of movement that we found in Shot
III (see Figure I ) .
   But in looking at the shot-frames themselves, do w�
find the ' same graph of linear composition, which with ·
the line of musical movement '\velded)' together Shots
III and IV with their music (measures 5 , 6, 7, 8) ?
   No. '
1 80               THE FILM      S ENSE


    And yet the sensation of an audio-visual unity seems
just as powerful in these combinations.
    Why?
    The explanation can be found in our previous discus­
sion of the various possible expressions of the line of
movement. T�e graph of movement that we found for
Shots III and IV need not be confined to the line a-b-c
alone, but may be expressed through any plastic means
at our disposal. Thus we encounter in practice the hy­
pothetical cases suggested above.
   Let us supplement our previous discussion with the
aid of our three new cases-I, VI-VII, IX-X.
   CASE I . Photography cannot convey the full sensa­
tion of Shot I, for this shot fades into sight: appearing
                             -
from the darkness we firsr see on the left a dark group
of men with a banner, and then gradually revealed is a
mottled sky, irregularly spotted with clouds.
   We can see that the movement inside this shot is abso­
lutely identical with our description of the movement
within Shot III. The lone difference lies in the fact that
the movement of Shot I is not- linear, but is a movement
of gradual lighting of the frame-a movement of increas­
ing degree of lightness.
   So that our "starting platform" a, which corresponded
to the initial chord of Shot III, is here found in the dark­
ness before the fade-in begins-a "water-line" of dark­
ness from which the degrees of gradual lightening of the
frame can be counted. The "arching" here is formed
from the progressive chain of differing frames-each of
\V·hich is lighter than the preceding frame. The arc bing
         FORM AND CONTENT:           PRACTICE          lSI

of Shot III is reRected here by the curve of gradual
lightening of the full frame. The individual stages are
marked by the appearance of more and clearer cloud
spots. In the emergence of the fully lit frame, the dark­
est spot (the one in the center of the ' frame) appears
first. This is followed by a somewhat lighter one above.
Then we grow aware of the whole sky of a general light
tone-with a darker "fleece" in the lower right center
and in the upper left corner.
   We see that the curved line of m ovement is duplicated
here, down to a detail, but not expressed through the
contour of the plastic composition, but through a "line"
of light tonality .
   We can thus declare a correspondence between Shot I
and Shot III, in their identical basic motion, a corre­
spondence, in the former case, in tone.
   CASE 2 . Examine the pair of shots-VI-VII. These
should be examined as a pair, for the musical phrase A
which falls entirely within Shot I (over one picture) ,
here covers fully two pictures. The variation of phrase
A that is over Shots VI -VII can be identified as A z . (See
the general diagram of the ' whole fragment.)
   Let us check this combination according to our per­
 ception of the music.
   This is what we see in the first of the two shots: four
warriors with shields and upright spears stand at the .
left; behind them, further to the left edge, the contour
 of the high rock can be seen; into the further distance,
 but towards the right edge-ranks of warriors stretching
 into the distance.
                  THE FILM SENSE


    Without checking the reactions of others, the impres­
sion always made upon me by the first chord of measure
 l o is of a heavy mass of sound, rolling down along the
lines of spears from the top of the frame to the bottom:




                         FIGURE 3 .

   (Subj ective as this impression may have been, it was
precisely due to it that I felt the need for giving this
shot its particular place in the montage. )
   Behind the group o f four spearmen the line ' of war­
riors stretches out in stages of depth, to the right. The
most prominent "stage" is the transition from the en­
tirety of Shot VI to the entirety of Shot VII, which
continues the line of warriors in the same direction, fur­
ther into the distance. The dimensions of the warriors
in Shot VII are somewhat greater, but the general move­
ment into depth (in stages) carries on the movement of
Shot VI. In the second shot there is another clearly de-
          F O RM AND C O N T E N T: PRACTICE           183
fined stage: the white line �cof empty horizon on the right
edge of the frame. This element in Shot VII breaks the
continuous line of warriors and introduces us to a new
sphere-towards the horizon where the sky merges with
the frozen surface of Lake Chudskoye.
   Let us graph this basic movement through both frames
by means of stages:




                  1
      a                �                           I
                                                   Z
                 /



       /                 FIGURE   4.
     We have diagrammed the· troop groupings as though
they were the receding wings of a theater set-I, 2, 3, 4-
inwards. Our starting surface is formed by the four
spearmen of Shot VI. These coincide with our' screen's
surface, from which all the inward movement stems.
Drawing a line to unify these "theat�r wings," we ob­
tain a certain 'curve a, I, 2, 3, 4. Where have we seen
a . strikingly similar curve? This is still the same curved.
line of our "are," but now found not along the vertical
surface of the frame, as in Shot III, but moving in
horizontal perspective into the depth of the frame.
     This 'curve has exactly the same starting surface, our
                  T H E F I LM S ENS E

wing of four standing warriors. In addition to this, the
several phases have defined limits, giving sharp edges to
the succeeding wings, that can be enclosed by four ver­
tical lines: the three warrior figures that stand away
from the troop-line in Shot VII (x, y, z)-and the line
that separates Shot VI from Shot VII.
   Can we find a correspondence in the music to that
glimpsed cut of horizon in VII?
   A fact to be considered in this connection: the music
of phrase A z does not extend over the entirety of Shots
VI and VII, so that the phrase B z begins to be heard
during Shot VII. This beginning includes three-quarters
of measure 1 2.
   What do these three-quarters contain?
   Exactly that chord preceded by a sharply accented
sixteenth, which in Shot III corresponded to the feeling
of an abrupt fall downward from Shot III into Shot IV.
   In the former case the whole movement was placed
along a vertical surface, and the abrupt musical break
was visualized as a fall (from the upper right corner of
frame III to the lower left corner of frame IV). Here
the whole movement is horizontal-into the depth of the
frame. The plastic equivalent to such a sharp break in
the music can be assumed under these conditions to ap­
pear as an analogous jolt-now not frqm top to bottom,
but perspectively, inwards. The "jolt" in Shot VII from
the line of warriors to the horizon line is exactly such
a jolt. Again we attain a "maximum break," since in
landscape the horizon represents the limit of depth!
   We are justified in considering this strip of horizon
         F O RM AND CO N T E N T: PRACTICE             185

to the right of Shot VII as a visual equivalent to the
musical "jolt" between measure I I and three-quarters
of measure 12.
   We should· add that from a purely psychological
viewpoint, this audio-visual correspondence conveys a
full_and precise feeling to the audience, whose attention
is pulled beyond the horizon to sOllle unseen point from
which they are expecting the foe to attack.
   Thus we see that like strips of music-such as the
"jolt" at the beginning of measures 7 and 12-can be
plastically solved by varying the means of the plastic
break.
   In one case it is a break along a vertical line during
the transition from shot to shot-III-IV. In the other
case-a break along a horizontal line, within the frame
of Shot VII at point M. (See Figure 4.)
   But this is not all that can be found in these two pairs
of shots. In III our "arc" sprang across the surface. In
VI-VII it sprang inwards in perspective, that is, spa­
tially. Along this second "arc" was strung our system of
theater wings, unfolding into space itself. This recession
from the surface of the screen (wing a) into the space
of the screen, accompanies the scale of upward climbing
sounds.
   Thus in the case of VI -VII, we can point to another
kind of correspondence between music and picture�
solved through the same graph-and with the same mo­
tion. This is-spatial correspondence.
   Let us draw a general graph of this new variant of
corresponding music and pictorial representation. To
18 6              T H E F I LM S E N S E

complete our picture we should finish phrase B in the
score (by adding one measure and a quarter-note). This
will give us a full repeat of the musical phrase that we
examined with Shots III and IV. But our pictorial line
will demand the addition of Shot VIII to VI-VII-for
this repeat of phrase B (actually B z here) closes with
the completion of Shot VIII.
    So Shot VIII demands our inspection at this point.
    Plastically it can be divided into three parts. In the
foreground our attention is caught by the first close-up
to appear thus far in the sequence of eight shots-Vasilisa
in a helmet. This occupies only a part of the frame, leav �




ing the rest to the front-line of troops, placed in the
frame in much the same way as in the preceding frames.
Shot VIII serves as a transition shot, since it contains,
first, a plastic completion of the motif in VI-VII. (We
should not forget that the further recession inwards of
Shot VII has the effect of an enlargement, in relative
size to Shot'VI, providing an opportunity for a further
change in Shot VIII to a close-up.) The three shots­
VI-VII-VIII-are further tied together organically by
their correspondence with the musical sequence A z-B I .
The furtbest margins of t,hese four measures 10, I I, 12,
 I 3 coincide with the furthest edges of. the pair of shots
-VI -VIII, although within this grouping, the divisions
between Shots VII and VIII do not coincide with the
divisions between measures I I and 12. (See the general
diagram.)
    Shot VIII completes the phrase of mediu111 shots of
          F O R M A ND C O N T E N T: PRACTICE         187
troops (VI-VII-VIII) and introduces the phrase of
close-ups (VIII-IX-X) which now appears.
   In this same way the phrase of the prince on the rock
was carried through Shots I-II-III, and was followed by
a new phrase of long shots of warriors at. the foot of the

rock. This second phrase was introduced not by a cross­
ing in a single shot, but through a montage crossing.
   Following Shot III comes the phrase "the troops,"
shown in a long shot (IV), followed by "the prince on
the rock" again-also shown in a long shot (V).
   This essential· transition from "prince" to "troops" is
markeo by an essential musical change-a transition from
one tonality to another (C minor to C sharp minor).
   A less important transition-not from one theme
 (prince) to another theme (troops), but within a theme
-from a middle shot of warriors to close-ups of them­
is not solved through a montage crossing (as in III-IV­
V-VI) but within one shot-Shot VIII.
   This solution is by means of a composition containing
two planes: the new theme is shown in close-up, emerg­
ing in the foreground, while the fading theme (the long
shot of the front-line) recedes into the background. One
may note, besides this fact, that the "fading" of the pre­
ceding theme is also expressed by filming the troops (in
the second plane of distance) with a deliberate avoidance
of depth of focus, so that this slightly out-of-focus re-:­
ceding line provides a background for Vasilisa's close­
up.
   This close-up of Vasilisa introduces the other close­
ups-of Ignat and Savka (IX-X) which, joined to the
1 88              T H E FI L M S E N S E

last two shots of this fragment (XI-XII), will give u s a
new plastic interpretation for our graph of motion.
   But this part of our analysis has to wait for our next
step.
   On our examination of Shot VIII depends the com­
pletion of our graph for the group of shots (VI-VII­
VIII).
   The three divisions of Shot VIII can be described
thus:
   In the foreground-Vasilisa's face in close-up. Further
to the right in the frame is a long row of troops-photo­
graphed without sharply defined focus, which results in
emphasizing the high-lights on their helmets. In the nar­
row section between Vasilisa's head and the left edge of
the frame can be seen part-of the line of troops, topped
by a banner.
   What corresponds to this in the musical score?
   This shot is covered by one whole musical measure
and a quarter-note-the end of measure 12 and the whole
of measure 1 3. This musical fragment contains three dis­
tinct elements, of which the middle one-the chord that
opens measure 1 3-comes to the foreground. This chord
has the "impact" of a full fusion with the close-up in
our shot.
   From the middle of this measure start four eighth ..
notes, interrupted by rests. Just as this even horizontal
musical movement was accompanied by the tiny flags
of Shot IV, the slightly shifting high-lights on the hel­
mets of the troop-line in Shot VIII accompany these
notes like little stars.
   Only our left edge lacks its musical "correspondence."
          FO R M A ND C O N T E N T: PRA C T I C E           189
But-we have forgotten die eighth-note, remaining over
from the preceding measure I 2, and which "on the left"
precedes the opening chord of measure I 3; it is this
eighth-note that "corresponds" to the narrow strip of
frame to the left of Vasilisa's head.
   This analysis of Shot VIII and its corresponding mu­
sical movement can be diagrammed thus:




                            FIGURE 5.


   At this point I expect to hear a quite natural exclama­
tion-"Hold on there! Isn't it a little far-fetched to
match a line of music so exactly to a pictorial represen­
tation? Doesn't the left of a measure of music and the              .




left of a picture signify absolutely different things? "
   A 'Inotionless picture exists spatially, that is, si'lnultane­
ously, and neither its left, nor its right, nor its center
Can be ,thought of as occupying any order in time,
while the musical staff contains a definite order 'Inoving
                  T H E F I LM S ENS E

in time. In the staff the left always signifies "before,"
while the right signifies "after.'}'}
   All the above objections would carry weight if our
shot contained elements that appeared in succession, as
indicated by the diagram (Figure 6) opposite.
   The objections at first sound quite reasonable.
   And then we realize that an extremely important fac­
tor has been ignored, namely, that the motionless whole
of a picture and its parts do not enter the perception
simultaneously (with the exception of those cases where
the composition is calculated to create just such an
effect) .
   The art of plastic composition consists in leading the
spectator's attention through the exact path and with
the exact sequence prescribed by the author of the com­
position. This applies to the eye's movement over the
surface of a canvas if the composition is expressed in
painting, or over the surface of the screen if we are
dealing with a film-frame.
   It is interesting to note here that at an earlier stage
of graphic art, when the conception of "the path of the
eye" was still difficult to separate from a physical image
-that paths were introduced into pictures as paths of
the eye, concrete picturizations of roads along which
were distributed the events that the. artist wished to
portray in particular sequence. One of the most dramatic
 (and cinematic) of all illuminated manuscripts is the
Greek manuscript of the sixth century known as the
Vienna Genesis 14-in which this device is employed re­
peatedly. There it waS solely concerned with a sequence

of scenes which, often i n this period, were depicted in
one painting. Development of this device continued into
the era of perspective, where the scenes were placed in
the different planes of a painting, similar to the effect of
a. path. Thus, Dirk Bouts' painting of The Drea1n of

Elijah in th.e Desert shows Elijah sleeping in the fore­
ground, while another Elijah departs on a path that
winds into the depth of the picture. In The Adoration
of the Shepherds by Domenico Ghirlandaio, the Infant
surrounded by shepherds occupies the foreground, and
on a road that twists forward from the background
appear the Magi; so that the road ties together events
which are, in subject, thirteen days apart (December 24
-January 6).
   Memling used this same device, but in a far more com­
plex (and exciting) composition, in distributing all the
consecutive Stations of the Cross through the streets of
a city, in his Passion of Christ, now in Turin.
   Later on, when such jumps in time disappear, the
physical road, as one of the means of plotting the spec­
                                 -
tator's view of a painting, also disappears.
   The road is transformed into the path of the eye,
transferred from a sphere of representation to one of
composition.
   The means employed in this further -stage of develop­
ment are varied, although they have one characteristic
in common: there is usually something in a painting
which attracts attention before all other elements. From
this point the attention moves along that path desired by
the artist. This path can be described either by a move-
            F O RlVI A ND CO N T E N T: PR ACTICE             193
ment-line, or as a path of ·graduated tones, or even by
grouping or the "play" of personages in the picture.
A classic case of deciphering in this regard is Rodin's
analysis of Watteau's L'E111barquement pour Cytbere
which I cannot forbear quoting here:
  In this masterpiece the action, if you "vill notice, begins
in the foreground to the right and ends in the background
to the left.
  What you first notice in the front of the picture, in the
cool shade, near a sculptured bust of Cypris garlanded with
roses, is a group composed of a young WOD1an and. her
adorer. The man "vears a cape embroidered \vith a pierced
heart, gracious symbol of the voyage that he would under­
take.
  Kneeling at her side, he ardently beseeches his lady to
yield. But she meets his entreaties with an indifference per­
haps feigned, and appears absorbed in the study 'of the
decorations on    her   fan. Close to them is a little cupid, sit­
ting half-naked upon his quiver. He thinks that the young
woman delays too long, and he pulls her skirt to induce
her to be less hard-hearted. But still the pilgrim's staff and
the script of love lie upon the ground. This is the first
scene.
  Here is the second: To the "left of the group of whieh
I have spoken is another couple. The lady accepts the hand
of her lover, who helps her to arise. She has her back to us,
and has one of those blonde napes which Watteau painted
with such voluptuous grace.
  A     little further a\vay is the third scene. The lover puts
his arm around his mistress's waist to draw her with him.
She turns towards her companions, \vhose lingering con­
fuses her, but she allows herself to be led passively away.
  Now the lovers descend to the shore and all push laugh-
1 94               T H E F I LM S E N S E

ing towards the barque; the men n o longer need t o entreat,
the women cling to their arms.
   Finally the pilgrims help their sweethearts on board the
little ship, which, decked with flowers and floating pennons
of red silk, rocks like a golden dream upon the water. The
sailors, leaning on their oars, are ready to row away. And
already, borne by the breezes, little cupids fly ahead to
guide the travellers towards that azure isle which lies upon
the horizon.15
  Have we any right to claim that our film-frames also
can gauge the movement of the eye over a determined
path?
  We can give an affirmative answer to this, and add
further-that in the twelve shots we are analyzing that
this movement proceeds precisely from left to right
through each of the twelve shots identically, and fully
corresponds in its pictorial character with the character
of the 111usic's 1novelnent.
   We have said the music has t\VO phrases-A and B
-alternating throughout the length of the entire frag­
ment.
   A is constructed thus:

  First, a chord. Then against the background of the
resonance of the chord, is an ascending scale, * moving
in an "arc," or else, a recurrence of one note in a
horizontal movement.
   Plastically all the frames are constructed in the same
way (except IV and XII, which do not really function
as independent shots, but as continuations of the move­
ment of preceding shots).
   Actually they each have on the left a darker, more
solid, heavy plastic "chord" which commands the eye's
attention first.
   In Shots I-II-III this "chord" is a group of dark fig­
ures, placed on the heavy mass of the rock. These attract
our attention for another reason: they are the only living
people in the frame.
   In Shot V-these figures, but with a greater mass of
rock.
   In Shot VI-the four spearmen in the foreground.
   In Shot VII-the mass of the troops, and so on.
   And in each of these shots there is something to the

the cellos, rising in a C minor scale.
                  THE FILM SENSE

right of the frame which occupies the secondary at­
tention: something light, airy, consecutively "moving"
which compels the eye to follow it.
   In Shot III-the upward "arc."
   In Shots VI-VII -the "theater wings" of the troops,
inward.
   So that for the entire plastic system of frames the
left side is "before," while the right is "later," for the
eye has been directed in a particular way from left to
right through each of these motionless frames.
   In the process of dividing up the frame compositions
along a vertical line, this gives us the right to mark our
musical beats and measures among the various plastic
elements that make up the�e frames.
   I t was upon our perception of this circumstance that
we based our montage of this particular sequence-and
made our audio-visual correspondences more precise.
This analysis, certainly as painstaking for the reader as
it was for its writer, could only be done, of course,
post factum, but it is worth doing to prove to what de­
gree compositional "intuition'" is responsible for correct
audio-visual structures-and how those senses of "in­
stinct" and "feeling" can materialize sound-picture mon­
tage. It hardly seems necessary to point out that this is
premised wholly on a wish for truth in the choice of
theme, and a desire for vitality in its treatment.

   From frame to frame in our sequence, the eye be­
comes accustomed to "read" the picture from left to
right.
             F O Rl\1 A ND CO N T E N T: PRACTICE                1 97
   Moreover, this continuous horizontal reading of the
sequence induces horizontal reading in general, so that
frames are psychologically perceived as placed side by
side upon a horizontal line in the same left-to-right di­
rection.
   This is what allows us not only to divide each frame
"in time" upon our vertical line, but also to place fra1ne
after frame upon a horizontal line, and describe their
correspondence to the music in this precise way.
   Let us continue to take advantage of this circumstance
by describing in one gesture the succession of Shots
VI-VII-VIII, along with the movement of the music
that is fused with these shots, and the movement of that
total plastic motion upon which both picture and music
are based. (See general diagram.) This is the same mo­
tion that goes through the combination of Shots III-IV.
An interesting distinction here between the motion
through two shots and the same motion through three
shots, is that the effect of a "fall" is, in the latter case,
placed within the frame (Shot VII), rather than at the
transition between t\VO shots (Shot III to IV). *
   Upon this graph and with"the addition of the remain­
ing frames, we can construct the general graphic dia­
gram for the �hole fragment. Comparing the III-IV
graph with the VI-VII-VIII graph, we can see how
  •   The differing diagrammed lengths of the musical measures    (10
and 12, for example) bear no relation to the content, either of the
music or of the frames. This, and the occasional stretching of the
notes within the frame limits have been conditioned exclusively by
the exigen�ies of diagramming.
                  T H E F I LM S E N S E

much more complicated in the case of the latter is the
audio-visual developn1ent of "variations" on a basic line
of movement.
   We have noted that the movement from left to right
through each frame has given a psychological suggestion
that the frames are actually set next to one another upon
a horizontal line running in one direction-to the right.
This peculiarity permitted the arrangement of our dia­
gram in the way you see it.
   In connection with this, another much more impor­
tant factor of a different type is now revealed. The psy­
chological effect of left-to-right combines the total se­
quence into a focused shaping of the attention, directed
from somewhere at the left towards somewhere at the
right.
   This underlines our dramatic "indicator" -which is a
direction of the eyes of all personages in these shots to­
wards one point-with only one exception, the close-up
of Ignat in IX.
   In Shot IX Ignat looks to t?e left, but precisely be­
cause of this our general direction of attention towards
the right is thereby strengthened.
   This close-up emphasizes our general direction, "\vhich
is developed by the "triple-sounding" of close-ups VIII­
IX-X, where it holds a middle position for the short­
est period of time-only three-quarters of a measure­
while Shots VIII and X occupy a measure plus an eighth
and a measure plus a quarter respectively.
         F O R M A N D C O N T E N T: PRACT I C E   1 99
  This turn towards the left replaces what would have
been a monotonous series


                         - --
                         FIGultE 9.

with a nervous series:

in which the third close-up (Shot X) acquires, instead
of a general, vaguely expressive direction, which the
first arrangement would have produced, even sharper
emphasis for its rightward direction by being photo­
graphed with a 1 800 lens.
   Examples can be found of Pushkin's adherence to a
similar construction. In Ruslan and Ludmila he tells of
those who were killed in battle against the Pechenegs:
one struck by an arrow, another smitten by a mace, and
a third trampled by a horse.
   A sequence of arrow, mace, horse would have cor­
responded with a direct crescendo.
   Pushkin, however, gives a different arrangement. He
distributes the "weight" of the blow, not in a simple
ascending line, but with a "recoil" in the middle link.
in the chain:
   not: arrow-mace-horse,
   hut: mace-arrow-horse.

           That one, felled b y a mace's blow;
           And that-struck by an arrow;
           Another, pressed to his shield,
           Crushed by a frenzied horse. . ,. 16
   So these separate movements of the eye from left to
right throughout �he sequence add up to a feeling of
something on the left, striving "with all its soul" in a
direction somewhere to the right.
   This is precisely the feeling that the entire complex
of twelve shots was seeking: the prince on the rock, the
army at the foot of the rock, the general air of expecta­
tion-all directed to that point, to the right, into the dis­
tance, somewhere beyond the lake, from which the as
yet invisible enemy will appear.
   At this point the enemy �is shown only through the
Russian army's expectation of it.
   Following these twelve shots are three empty frames
of the deserted icy surface of the lake.
   In the middle of the second of these three shots the
enemy appears "in a new quality"-through the sound­
ing of his horn. The sound of the horn ends upon a
shot of Alexander's group-to give a feeling that the
sound "came from afar" (the series of deserted land­
scapes) and finally "reached" Alexander (or "fell upon
the picture of the Russians").            .
   The entrance of the sound is in the 1niddle of a shot
of empty landscape, so that the sound is heard as if from
the middle of the picture-head on. It is then heard bead
on in the shot of the group of Russians (facing the

enemy).
         F O RM A N D C O N T E N T: PRA C T I C E     201

  The following shot discloses the distant cavalry line
of German knights, moving head on, appearing to flow
from the horizon with which it at first seemed to be
merged. (This theme of a head on attack is prepared
long in advance by Shots IV and XII�both head on
shot�-which was their chief role in the sequence, apart
from their function as plastic equivalents of the music
at these points.)
   To all that has been said a basic reservation must be
added.
   It is perfectly obvious that a horizontal reading of a
sequence of frames, attached to each other in a horizon­
tal conception, is not always pertinent. As we have
shown, in this case it flows entirely from the total image
sensation that is required of the sequence: a sensation
bound to a direction of the attention from left to right.
   This particular feature of our desired image is
achieved fully by both picture and music, and by gen­
uine inner synchronization of both. (Even the music
seems to expand, moving away from the heavy chords
of the "left" side. Try to imagine for a moment the
effect that would result from these chords being placed
to the "right," i.e., ending the phrases with chords; there
could be no sensation of "flight" to beyond the spaces
of Lake Chudskoye, such as is now achieved.)              ,
   In working to achieve other i11za ges in other cases­
                                         -




the composition of the frames can "train" the eye for
an entirely different plastic reading.
   The eye may be trained, not to attach one frame to
202               T H E F I L M S ENS E

another as in our fragment, but to place frame upon
frame-as layers.
   This would produce either a sensation of being drawn
into a depth or a sensation of pictures rushing towards
the spectator.
   Imagine, for instance, a sequence of four close-ups of
increasing size, each of a different person, each placed
centrally in its frame. A natural perception of this series
of shots would not be as diagrammed in the upper draw­
ing, but as in the lower:




      I




      n




                         FIGURE   I I.
         F O R M AND C O N T E N T: PR A C T I C E       203

   This would not-be a movement past the eye-from
left to right, but a movement either away from the eye
in a sequence of I , 2, 3, 4-or towards the eye, 4, 3, 2, I .
   What we have just noted is a second type of move­
ment in our analysis of the horn-sound and the change
to a head on movement into a depth-which follows our
      ·
first sequence.
   The sound falls on a shot similar to Shot XII -such a
shot as could be read just as well ("by inertia") from
left to right, as into a depth:




                          FIGURE   12.


                             '
   But two things help us to switch attention to a depth.
   First, the sound bursts from the temporal center of
the shot, so th�t our perception, guided by analogy and
a sense of space, places the sound in the spatial center
                                                        '
of the shot.
   Second, a step-like movement of the grayish-white
streaks of snow, moving upward from the bottom
frame-line.

                         FIGURE 13.


  This "ladder" carries the eye upward, but this upward
movement over the surface is at the same time an ap­
proach to the horizon; it can thus be read psychologi­
cally as a spatial movement towards the horizon, or into
the depth, which is exactly what we need here. This
                                 .
movement is further strengthened by the following shot,
which has an almost identical composition, but with a
lowered horizon-line-so that the increased expanse of
sky induces the eye to perceive an even greater distance.
Later this conditioned direction of the eye is materialized
-first audibly (with an approaching sound), and then
concretely (with the galloping riders) as the moment
of the attack draws nearer.
  With a systematic distribution of forms, lines or
         F O R M A N D C O N TE N T: PRA C T I CE     205
movements, it is just as poss�ble to train the eye for ver­
tical reading, or in any desired direction.
   There is a little more to add to our analysis of Shots
IX-X and XI-XII. As already mentioned, Shots IX-X
fall on phrase A I (equal to A, but in a. new tonality).
We may note that Shots XI-XII fall on phrase Bl in the
same 'vay.
   The general diagram shows that, unlike Shots III and
IV where one picture covers each two measures of the
phrases A and B, two pictures cover each two measures
of the phrases A I and B I .
   Let us see whether Shots IX-X-XI-XII repeat the
graph of motion that \ve determined for Shots III-IV.
If so, in what new aspect? The first three-quarters of
the first measure fall on the close-up, IX. These three­
quarters include the introductory chord-"the starting
platform," as we called it on other occasions. The pic­
ture that accompanies this chord seems almost like an en­
largement of part of Shot VI: the close-up of a bearded
man (Ignat) against a background thick with spears
might have been a closer camera set-up on the four
spearmen of Shot VI. The remaining fi.ve-quarters· of
the phrase fall over Shot X-the background of which is
relatively free of spears, compared to the background
of Shot IX. This "simplification" resembles that of Shot
VI, if you compare the left side of that frame with i�s
right side. Our "jolt" also can be found in this close-up'
-but here expressed in an entirely new manner-as puffs
of breath in the cold air, exhaled from a nervously tense
throat. The "are" in this instance is built upon a main
206               T H E F I LM S E N S E

element of growing suspense, now "acted" -increasing
the excitement.
   A new embodiment of our "motion" is revealed-a
psychological factor of play, of acting-woven into the
rising emotion.
   Along with this factor, we may visualize Shot X as
having volume. In the transition from Shot X to Shot
XI, analogous to the "fall" of III-IV, we have no less
sharp a jolt from a rounded volume-Savka's young face
in close-up-to a long shot of small figures, with their
backs to the camera, peering into the distance. This jolt
is produced not only through an abrupt decrease of
dimensions, but also through the full about-face of the
personages.
   These two shots-X and XI-are analogous to the right
and left sides of Shot VII. Each half of Shot VII is given
here a whole frame, producing its own effect. Naturally
these are enriched and given more weight (compare VII
and XI, or the strip of horizon in VII with the whole
frame of deserted frozen lake in Shot XII) .
   Echoes of the other elements -can be found here, also.
The tapping off of flags that we remarked in Shot IV,
and the moving high-lights of Shot VIII here appear as
vertical streaks, alternating white and gray, stretching
across the icy surface.
   Thus we can find the same graph of motion that de­
termined the synchronization of the inner movement
of music and picture, reappearing in varying plastic
means:
   Tonally (Shot I)
         F O R M AND C O N T E N T: PRA CTIC E        207

   Lineally (Shot III)
   Spatially (the wings of Shots VI-VII)
   Dramatically and substantially (by the acting in
      Shots IX-X and by the plastic transition from the
     close-up volume of Shot X to the reduced volumes
     of Shot XI)
   And, too, the anxious awaiting of the enemy was it­
self expressed through several kinds of variations: by
vague, "general" half-uttered means through the light
of Shot I, then the line of Shot III, then by mise-en­
scene and the grouping of Shots VI-VII, and finally by
a fully edited integration of Shots VIII-IX-X.
   There is one shot that we have not yet touched in
our analysis-Shot V. In referring to it above we called
it a "transitional" shot. Thematically this is an exact de­
scription: a transition from the prince on the rock to
the troops at its foot.
   This shot also contains a musical transition-and its
change from one tonality to another is consistent with
its thematic function, and with the plastic character of
the shot. This is the only frame in the sequence where
the "arc" is transposed from the right of the frame to the
left side. Here it serves to outline, not the airy part of
the frame, but the heavy, solid part: here the arc does
not move upward, but downward-all of which is in
full correspondence with the music: a clarinet in t�e
bass expressing a movement downward against a back-'
ground of violins, tremolo.
   Despite these differences this frame cannot be freed
completely from its responsibilities to the whole se-
208               T HE F I L M S E N SE

quence. In theme this shot is completely linked with the
other shots.
   The different character of this shot could be explained
without any hesitation if it contained some antagonistic
element-if, for example, the German knights appeared,
in any aspect, in this shot. Such a sharp cut, deliberately
breaking up the general texture of the sequence, would
have been in such a case not only "desirable," but actu­
ally necessary. The enemy theme does break in thus,
with a harsh, new sound, a few shots later, as described
above. Later the "clashing" themes of the two foes cross
in a combat of clashing shots: in a clash of montage
strips, sharply differing in composition and structure­
white German knights-black Russian troops; immobile
Russian troops-galloping riders; open, living emotional
Russian faces-German faces hidden by the visors of
iron masks.
   This clashing of the two foes is first shown as a clash
of shots assembled by Dleans of contrast-solving the in­
troductory phase of the battle without as yet bringing
the troops into contact. A filmic battle has already be­
gun, however, by means of this clash of the plastic ele­
ments that characterize the antagonists for us.
   But no such full clash takes place between Shot V
 and the other shots. Despite the fact o� a difference be­
 tween the features of Shot V and the features of the
 other shots, V does not break away from their unity.
   How is this achieved?
   Since we have seen that the features of Shot V are
 torn away from the features of the other shots in almost
         F O R M AND C O N TEN T: PRACTICE            209

every respect, we will, apparently, have to look beyond
the limits of this frame alone for the answer.
  Examining the entire series of pictures, we shall
quickly discover two frames which, to a lesser degree,
describe the same inverted curved arc that characterizes
the descending line of the rock in Shot V.
  We find that Shot V is placed roughly half-way be­
tween these two.
  One shot prepares for the appearance of Shot V. The
other cancels it out.
  These two shots, so to speak, "amortize" the appear­
ance and disappearance of Shot V, "\vhose coming and
going without them would have been too abrupt.
  These two shots are II and VIII.
  In fact, if we draw a directional line of their two
maln masses, we can see a coincidence with the rock
contour of Shot V:
           SHOT   II                    SHOT   VIII




                        FIGURE 14.


   Shot V differs from Shots II and VIII in that this
line is not physically drawn, but functions as a construc-

tion line along which the main shapes of I I and VIII
arISe.
   In addition to this more fundamental welding of Shot
V to the other shots, there are also curious "clamps" that
hold V to its imlnediate neighbors-IV and VI.
 , It is tied to Shot IV by the tiny banner fluttering
above the rock, continuing the play of flags over the
troop-line in Shot IV; the last musical accent of the
flags actually coincides with the appearance of the ban­
ner in Shot V.
   Shot V is tied to Shot VI by the black contour of
the rock, whose base occupies the left of frame VI.
   This rock base has an importance other than the
considerations of its plastic-compositional elements. It
conveys topographical info.rmation-proving that the
army is really at the foot of Raven Rock. The lack of
such "information trifles" too often leads to a lack of
definite topographical and strategic logic, allowing most
film battles to melt into an hysterical chaos of skirmishes
through which it is impossible to discern the general
picture of the whole developing event.
   Aside from these elements, we should note here an­
other means of achieving compositional unity-through
a mirror type of contrast. The same unity can be felt in
Shot V that can be felt quantitatively. by representing
the same quantity with a plus and with a minus sign.
   Our perception of, this shot would be entirely differ­
ent if, for example, Shot V had contained not only the
same (though inverted) curve of the arc, but also a
broken or a straight line. Then we would have sought its
         F O R M AND C O N T E N T: PRACTICE          2I I

relationships among such �opposites as black-white, im­
mopile-moving, etc., where we would be dealing with
qualities that are diametrically opposite rather than with
equal quantities equipped with differing indications.
   However, such general considerations could lead us
very far afield.
   L-et us instead exploit our established fact-that we
may dra\v a general diagram of audio-visual correspond­
ence and a motion graph of this correspondence through
our entire analyzed sequence. (During this resume of
the analysis it is advisable to follow the argument while
keeping an eye on the general diagram.)
   For this stage of the discussion we will overlook the
details of how the repeats and variations are interwoven
harmoniously. In this respect the diagram is quite clear
in itself, both through its spacing and its figures.
   There is another question that has not yet been
touched in the analysis.
   At the beginning of Part II we laid down a general
principle, according to which audio-visual unity and
correspondence is to be achieved. "\IVe defined this as a
unity of both elements in an "image," i.e., through a
unifying image.
   We have just discovered that the "unifier" of the
plastic and the" music elements is the impulse of a move­
ment that frequently and repeatedly passes through an
                                                          .
entire sequence construction. Isn't there a contradiction
here? Or may we, on the other hand, maintain that
within our typical linear figure (that is, typical for a
certain part of the work) there is a definite "imagery,"
212                T H E F I L M SEN SE

and that that imagery is firmly connected with the
"theme" of the part?
   Does this appear in our general graph of motion, as
shown in Figure I?
   If we try to read this graph emotionally in conjunc­
tion with the thematic matter of the sequence, checking
one against the other, we can find a "seismographical"
curve of a certain process and rhythm of uneasy expec­
tation.
   Beginning with a state of relative calm, it develops
into an increasing upward movement-which can be
read as a period of tenseness-waiting.
   Near the surnlnit of this tension, there is a sudden dis­
charge, a complete fall-lik�_ an escaping sigh.
   This similarity cannot really be considered acci­
dental, because the apparently similar structure of the
emotional graph is actually the prototype of the motion
graph itself, which, like every living compositional
graph, is a fragment of the activity of man, colored in
a certain emotional way-a fragment of the regularity
and the rhythm of this activity.'
   The line a-b-c on Figure I very clearly reproduces
the state of "holding one's breath," holding in the ex­
halation until the chest is ready to burst-to burst not
only with the increasing intake of air, but also with the
increasing emotion that is bound to the physical act.
-"Any moment now the enemy will appear on the hori­
zon." And then, "No, he is not yet in sight." And you
sigh with relief: the expanding chest suddenly collaps­

simple description, one involuntarily places after this
action . . . -three dots: the three dots of a pulsing
anti-climax reacting to the previously increased tension.
   Here something else catches our attention in the
graph. A repeated stationary feeling matched to the
introductory chord of the new musical phrase before
again climbing to suspense-then a fall-and so on. And
so the entire process moves ahead, rhythmically, in­
variably repeating itself with the very monotony that
makes suspense so unbearable for those who are experi­
encing it. . ..
   Deciphered in this way, our graph of curved ascen­
sions, falls and horizontal resonances may be rightly
considered as the limits to be reached by a graphic
embodiment of that image which fuses the proc�ss of a
certain state of excited suspense. *
   Such a construction can obtain realistic fullness, and
the full imagery of "suspense" only through the fullness
of the shot-frames-only when these frames are filled
with a plastic representation that is composed according
to the most generalized graph of. our theme.
    •   ... as Osmin's rage
        "                      gradually increases, there comes         (just
when the aria seems to be at an end) the allegro assai, which is in
a   totally different measure and in a different -key; this is bound to
be very effective.For just as a man in such a towering rage over­
steps all the bounds of order, moderation and propriety and com­
pletely forgets himself, so must the music too forget itself. But as
music ... must never cease to be        1nusic,   I have gone from F (the
key in which the aria is written), not into a remote key, but into
a   related one, not, however, into its nearest relative D minor,. but
into the more remote A minor." lVlozan, in a letter to his father,
September 26,    1781,   regarding   Die Entfuhrung aus    denz   Serail.17
214               THE FILM SENSE

   Along with a firm generalized graph of the sequence's
emotional content sounded several times in the musical
score, the element of the changing pictorial representa­
tions carries the responsibility for increasing the theme
of suspense.
   In our sequence we see a growing intensity of varying
representations passing consecutively through a series of
varying dimensions:
   I . Tonal I.

   2. Linear III-IV.

   3. Spatial VI-VII-VIII.
   4. Substantial (the masses of the close-ups) and, at
       the same time: Dramatic (the playing of these
       close-ups on throug� IX-X-XI-XII).
                            _
                             _




   The very order in which these dimensions change
forms a definitely growing line-from unsubstantial,
vaguely alarming "play of light" (the fade-in) up to
the clear, concrete human action, the activity of realistic
characters, realistically awaiting a realistic foe.
   One question remains to be answered-a question
asked by every listener o� reader for whom any picture
of the regularity of compositional structures is laid out
for the first time: "Did you know all this beforehand?
Did you anticipate it beforehand? Did you really cal­
culate this in such detail beforehand?�'
   This sort of question usually betrays an ignorance in
the questioner as to the true manner in which the cre­
ative process proceeds.
   It is a mistake to think that with the composition of
a shooting-script, no matter how "ironclad" or "fool-
         F O R M A ND C O N T E N T: PRA C T I C E     215
proof" it might be -judged; the creative process is ended.
Unfortunately this is an opinion I very often hear ex­
pressed-,-that the creative job is ended as soon as the
compositional formulae are drawn up, and that it is thus
that all the subtleties of construction are pre-determined.
   This is far from a true picture of the process-and at
the -most, only to a certain degree is it even a possible
picture.
   It is especially far from the truth in respect to those
scenes and sequences of a "symphonic" construction,
where the shots are connected by a dynamic process,
developing a broad emotional theme, rather than by
some sequence of the plot's phases, which may develop
only in that definite order and that definite sequence
dictated by common sense.
   This is connected with another circumstance-that
during the period of work one rarely formulates these
"hows" and "whys" which determine this or that choice
of "correspondence." In the work period the basic se­
lection is transmuted, not· into logical evaluation, as in a
post-analysis of this sort, but into direct action.
   Build your thought not through inference, but lay it
out directly in fra1nes and in the course of composition.
   I involuntarily recall Oscar Wilde's denial that an art­
ist's ideas �re . born "naked," and only later dressed in
marble, paint and sound.
   The artist thinks directly in terms of manipulating
his resources and materials. His thought is transmuted
into direct dction, formulated not by a formula, but by
a form�
216               T HE F I L M S E N S E

  Even in this "spontaneity" the necessary laws, bases,
motivations for precisely sucb and no otber distribution
of one's elements pass through the consciousness (and
are sometimes even uttered aloud), but consciousness
does not stop to explain tbese motivations-it hurries on
towards contpletion of tbe structure itself. The pleasure
of deciphering these "bases" remains to post-analysis,
which sometimes occurs years after the "fever" of the
creative "act" has passed-that "act" which Wagner, at
the height of his creative rise in 1 8 5 3, referred to in
refusing to contribute to a review devoted to musical
theory which was being organized by his friends:
"When you create-you do not explain." 1 8
   The laws governing the fruits of the creative "act"
are in no sense relaxed or reduced thereby-as we have
endeavored to demonstrate in the above analysis.
         I.   THE WORK OF EISENSTEIN
                         ( 1920-1 947 )
   (Note to Revised Edition: This list has been corrected
                                                      .
                                                          and sup-
plemented by Ivor Montagu.)


   This record has been compiled with the intention of
providing a fully rounded pictu!e of Eisenstein's creative
car�er, beginning with his work as designer in the theater.
The list includes not only his six finished films, but also
the unrealized proj ects and unachieved dreams without
which the record of any artist's career is incomplete. The
titles in bold-face are those of the six completed films.
   Sergei Mikhailovich Eisenstein was born in 1 898 and edu­
cated in St. Petersburg. A student of engineering and archi­
tecture, his interest in the theater did not become active
until the Civil War, when as an engineer attached to a Red
Army fortification corps he organized an amateur theater
group. After demobi�ization, he found \vork as a theater
designer in Moscow.

The first of a proposed series of films on pre-revolutionary
working-class activities. Its original intent was almost purely
educational, but the finished film was as dynamic and ex­
perimental as might be expected of Eisenstein's first film.
It was one of the prize-winning Soviet films at the 1 9 2 5
Exposition des Arts Decoratifs i n Paris, and i t was commer­
cially exhibited in Germany, but it has not been seen in
America or England.

THE STORMING OF LA SARRAZ
This unfinished film was the result of Eisenstein, Tisse and
Alexandrov attending an international film congress held
in the ancient chateau of La Sarraz in Switzerland. One of
the delegates (Jeannine Bhoussinousse, clad in a white robe
,vith two empty film-reels for breastplates) was suspended
with ropes from the topmost tower where, as "the spirit of
the artistic film," she was the obj ect for contention of two
armies: that of Commerce, led by Bela Balasz in full armor,
and that of Independence, led by Eisenstein, mounted on
a proj ection table and tilting with both lance and projec­
tion apparatus. Other remembered warriors were Leon
Moussinac as Wallenstein, Hans Richter as General Tilly,
and Walter Ruttmann as St. George. This riot was "di­
rected" by Eisenstein, Richter and Montagu, and Richter
is credited with most of the improvised script. Tisse had
to shoot the entire allegorical j est in a single day, because
the outraged hostess demanded a stop to the congress's
eccentricities. The short but uncut film ""vas lost in some
Berlin film vault.

THE ROAD TO BUENOS AIRES
The reportage by Albert Londres was proposed to a French
company by Eisenstein and he ,vorked oVer it for a while
with Montagu before the proj ect evaporated. Eisenstein
privately explained his choice of the subject by his belief
in type-casting, for he would not have been able to make
a film in France without employing the lady friends of the
film's financiers .
             T H E W O R K OF E I S E N S T E I N       223

ZA'HAROFF
Eisenstein was attracted by a currently published biography
of Sir Basil Zaharoff, and suggested it to French and Eng­
lish companies at this time as well as, later, to Paramount
and to other American firms.

[Romance Senthnentale ]
A musical short film made by Alexandrov and Tisse in
Paris. Its producer would only put up the money for the
production (which included salaries for three) if Eisenstein
would agree to be named as co-director on it. Eisenstein did
agree, in advance. He also later wrote defending the pro­
duction from criticism as though it were indeed one of his
own, although his actual participation was not more than
as an occasional consultant.

ARMS AND THE MAN
George Bernard Shaw offered his play to Eisenstein if he
could get an American producer to do it and it was later
mentioned to Paramount, though without interest.

THE WAR OF THE WORLDS
When Eisenstein signed the contract with Paramount in
Paris, Jesse Lasky proposed to · him the H. G. Wells novel,
but the proj ect ,vas soon dropped as too costly.

GLASS HOUSE
Possibly suggested by Eugene Zamiatin's novel We. Eisen­
stein outlined the idea to Lasky, who was interested, but
the combined effons of Eisenstein, Alexandrov and Mon­
tagu, plus some writers from the Paramount lot (including
Oliver Garrett) , to find a story to express the idea, pro­
duced nothing.
224                  THE   F I L lVI   SENSE

SUTTER'S GOLD
The next proj ect submitted to Paramount. Along with a
treatment by Eisenstein,     Alexandrov and Montagu      (see
Appendix   5)   a detailed production schedule to demonstrate
how economically the film could be made (now in the
Eisenstein Collection at the lVluseum of Modern Art Film
Library) was turned in to Lasky.


AN AMERICAN TRAGEDY
The most completely developed of the several proj ects
submitted to Paramount. This adaptation and treatment of
Theodore Dreiser's novel was approved by the author but
rej ected by Paramount. See Appendix 4 and item 34 in
Bibliography. Ivor Montagu thus ascribes the authorship of
this and the previous Sutter's Gold scripts: "The scripts of
                                __



both these subj ects should be ascribed to S.M.E., G.V.A.
and LM. After a lot of research, of which E. of course did
ovenvhelmingly the most and initiated everything, he and
A. got out the first draft, which we then had translated,
whereupon he and I got out the second, the actual writing
of this being my j ob (as the writing of the first had been
A.'s) , the actual planning-general and detail-of both being
E.'s."


BLACK MAJESTY
A filn1 of the Haitian Revolution ,vas considered at various
times, and as early as Paris, before the Paramount contract
was signed. In addition to the John Vandercook novel of
this name, material ,vas also to be dra\vn from Anatoli
Vinogradov's The Black       Consul and Otten's play Der
Schwarze Napoleon. The idea of starring Paul Robeson was
also absorbed into the continuing proj ect.

ONCE I N A LIFETIME
Eisenstein obtained the Russian theatrical rights from Sam
H. 'Harris to the play by Moss Hart and George S. Kauf­
man, with a view to staging it on his return to Moscow.

"'A FILM IN JAPAN"
As the return home was first planned via Japan, a produc­
tion there was contracted by letter exchange. This was
cancelled by the change in traveling plans and the Mexican
film.

QUE VIVA MEXICO !
  Independently produced, through Upton Sinclair. Scenario and
  direction by Eisenstein and Gregori Alexandrov. Photographed
  by Edward Tisse.

The footage shot for this film was utilized in 1 93 3 by Sol
Lesser to make Thunder OVer Me�ico (based on one epi­
sode of the complete plan) and two short films, Death Day
and Eisenstein in Mexico. In 1 9 39 Marie Seton used addi-_
tional footage to release Time in the Sun (edited by Roger
Bumford from extant outlines for Que Viva Mexico!) .
Eisenstein himself has never seen his full footage nor any
uses that others have made of sections of it. See Appendix 6
and item 39 in Bibliography . .

"A TRAVEL FILM OF RUSSIA"
A project mentioned on Eisenstein's j ourney back to Mos­
cow.

"A MODERN GOTTERDAMMERUNG"
Another mentioned project, to be centered around the
story of Jvar Kreuger.
226                 T H E FIL M S E N S E

MMM
A comedy prepared by Eisenstein immediately upon his
return to Moscow. Although tentatively cast with Maxim
Shtraukh and Judith Glizer, this did not get beyond the
scenario stage.

MOSCOW
An ambitious historical film, planned to cover four centu­
ries of Moscow's existence as a leading Russian city. Co­
incidental with this plan was to be Eisenstein's return to the
stage, as director of a play by his co-scenarist, Natan Zarkhi
-Moscow the Second. Both film and play were halted by

This is the first of a proj ected series of three films, planned
before the Nazi invasion, but not begun until after the
evacuation of the Mosfilm Studio to Alma-Ata. The full
treatment (then in two parts) was published in 1 944, and
thereupon translated into English (see item 67 in Bibliog­
raphy) .

IVAN THE TERRIBLE (Part II)
Most of this Part II of the projected trilogy was shot dur­
ing the production of Part I, but its cutting (including
sequences in color) was not completed until the beginning
of 1 946. Immediately upon the completion of the cutting,
Eisenstein suffered an almost fatal heart-attack, confining
him to a hospit�l for the remainder of. the year. During this
time screenings of his work-print aroused considerable criti­
cal controversy, of which he was unaware until his release .
from the hospital. At present he is completing Part II for
release in 1 948.
    2.   M O NTA GE O F ATTRA CTI O N S


   This i s a n excerpt from Eisenstein's first published article,
printed in the magazine Lef in 1 92 3 . This statement \vas
made in connection with the preparation of his production
of Ostrovsky's play Enough Simplicity in Every Wise Man,
staged in the Proletkult Arena. Of particular interest in the
article is its formulation of a direction in Eisenstein's theater
work that was not to find complete realization until prac­
ticed in the film medium. This direction has developed so
consistently since Eisenstein entered films that a comparison
between this and his latest work in this volume reveals no
fundamental contradiction.



THE basic materials of the theater arise from the spectator
himself-and from our guiding of the spectator into a de­
sired direction (or a desired mood) , which is the main task
of every functional theater (agit, poster, health education,
etc.) . The weapons for this purp ose are to be found in all
the left-over apparatus of the theater (the "chatter" of
Ostuzhev no more than the pink tights of the prima-donna,
a roll on the kettledrums as much as Romeo's soliloquy,
the cricket on the hearth no less than the cannon fired
over the heads of the audience) . For all, in their individual
ways, bring us to a single ideal-from their individual laws
to their common quality of attraction.
   The attraction (in our diagnosis of the theater) is every
aggressive moment in it, i.e., every element of it that brings
to light in the spectator those senses or that psy chology that
influence his experience-every ele'flzent that can be verified
                               230
              M O N T A G E O F A T T R A C T I ON S         23 1

and  mathematically calculated to produce certain emotional
shocks in a proper order within the totality-the only means
by ' which it is possible to 111ake the final ideological con­
clusion perceptible. The way to knowledge-"Through the
living play of the passions"-applies specifically to the thea­
ter (perceptually ) .
   Sensual and psychological, of course, in the sense of effi­
cient action-as directly active as in the Theatre Guignole,
where an eye is gouged out, an arm or leg amputated before
the very eyes of the audience; or a telephorie communica­
tion is incorporated into the action to describe a horrible
event that is taking place ten miles away; or a situation in
which a drunkard, sensing his approaching end, seeks relief
in madness. Rather in this sense than in that branch of the
psychological theater where the attraction rests in the theme
only, and exists and operates beneath the action, although
the theme may be an extremely urgent one. (The mistake
made by most agit-theaters is in their satisfaction with those
attractions that already exist in their scripts.)
   I establish attraction as normally being an independent
and primary element in the construction of a theatrical
production-a molecular (i.e., compound) unity of the effi­
ciency of the theater and of theater in general. This is fully
analogous with the "pictorial storehouse" employed by
George Grosz, or the elements of photographic illustration
 [photo-montage] employed by Rodchenko.
   As difficult as "compound" may be to limit, it certainly
ends with th�t fascinating noble hero (the psychological
moment) and begins with the concentrated moment of his
personal charm (i.e., his erotic activity) , for the lyric ef£e<;t
of certain Chaplin scenes does not in the least detract from
the attractions communicated by the specific mechanics of
his movement; it is just as difficult to fix the boundary line
where, religious pathos moves into sadist satisfaction during
the torture scenes of the miracle plays.
23 2                 THE FILM SENSE

   The attraction has nothing i n common with the trick.
Tricks are accomplished and completed on a plane of pure
craftsmanship (acrobatic tricks, for example) and include
that kind of attraction linked to the process of giving (or
in circus slang, "selling") one's self. As the circus term in­
dicates, inasmuch as it is clearly from the - viewpoint of the
performer himself, it is absolutely opposite to the attraction
-which is based exclusively on the reaction of the audience.
   Approached genuinely, this basically determines tbe pos­
sible principles of construction as "an action construction"
 (of the whole production) . Instead .of a static "reflection"
of an event with all possibilities for activity within the limits
of the event's logical action, ·we advance to a new plane­
free montage of arbitrarily selected, independent (within
the given composition and the subject links that hold the
influencing actions together) attractions-all from the stand
of establishing certain final thematic effects-this is montage
of attractions.
   The theater is confronted with the problem of transform­
ing its "illusory pictures" and its "presentations" into a
montage of "real matters" while at the same time weaving
into the montage full "pieces of representation" tied to the
plot development of the subj ect, but now not as self­
enforced and all-determining, but as consciously contribut­
ing to the whole production and selected for their pure
strength as active attractions.
   It is not in a "revelation" of the playwright's purpose,
or the "correct interpretation of the author," or a "true
reflection of an epoch" that a production ' can base itself.
The only true and solid base for the action of a production
can be found in attractions and in a system of attractions.
With all details gathered together in the hand of the di­
rector, the attraction is always, in some way, intuitively
employed, but not on a plane of montage or construction,
but as part of a "harmonic composition" (from which de...
                          STRIKE                          233
rives a whole jargon-"�ective curtains, " "a rich exit," "a
good stunt, " etc.) , but this exists solely within the frame
of the subject's plausibility, chiefly unconsciously and in
the pursuit of something entirely different (usually some­
thing that is present in the rehearsals from the beginning) .
What remains to us in reworking the system of staging is
to shift the center of attention to that which is necessary,
scrutinizing everything for its value as a transitional, clari­
fying or factual exposition of the basic intentional line of
the staging, rather than for its ties to logical, natural and
literary traditional piety. Our job is to establish this way
as a production method (which has been the work of the
Proletkult Workshop since the autumn of 1 922).
   Schooling for the l1zontageur can be found in the cinema,
and chiefly in the music-hall and circus, which invariably
 (substantially speaking) puts on a good show-from the
spectator's viewpoint. This schooling is necessary in order
to build a strong music-haIl-circus program, resul�ing from
the situation found at the base of a play. . . .

             A SEQUENCE FROM
             4.
          AN AMERICAN TRAGEDY


   A copy of the "first treatment" of this script, dated Octo­
ber 9, 1930, and signed S. M.Eisenstein and Ivor Montagu,
is in the Eisenstein Collection at the Museum of Modern
Art Film Library, New York. The following sequence is
from Reel 10 of this script.



1 7 The surface of Big Bittern Lake.
     Pools of the inky black surface of the silent water.The
     dark reflection of the pines.
     Boats trembling on the motionless surface of the silent
     water. Their gunwales against a rude landing stage at
     the foot of steps rising to the small hotel. The beautiful
     panorama of the lake.

18   Standing by the landing stage' are Clyde and Roberta.
     They have just descended from the auto bus.
     "How pretty-how beautiful it is!" exclaims Roberta.
     Suddenly the hotel proprietor appears from behind the
     bus. Sprung up as if by magic, he busily praises the
     weather, greets his guests.
     Clyde notices that there are few people about and none
     to be seen upon the lake. Too late, he notices that the
     proprietor, praising his kitchen, has taken the grip from
     him and that Roberta is following him into the hotel
                              236
                 AN A M ERI CAN TRAGEDY                     237
     He makes a movement as if to get the grip back, but
     thinks better of it, and with a strange, hypnotized step,
     follows them.

19   Open, the white pages of the hotel register stare threat­
     eningly at him .
     . Clyde grows paler; settling himself, he signs a fictitious
       name-"Carl Golden" -keeping his initials (C.G.) and
       adding "and wife." Roberta, noting this, feels a pang
       of joy that she hides before those in the hotel.
     "It's very hot. I'll leave my hat an� jacket here-we'll
     be coming back early," says Robertar and she leaves both
     on a hanger in the halL

20 Losing his head and ignoring these incidents, Clyde
     takes his grip from the surprised proprietor and goes
     towards the boat stand. As he places the grip in a boat,
     he explains to the man: "We have our lunch in it."
     Too preoccupied to note a remark by the boatman, he
     helps Roberta in and, taking hold of the oars, pulls off
     from the shore.

2I   Thick pine forests line the shore, and behind them are
     to be seen the tops of the hills.
     The water of the lake is calm and 'dark.
     "What peace, what tranquillity" -says Roberta.
     Rowing, then stopping, Clyde listens to this silerice,
     looks about him. There is no one around.

22 As the boat glides into the darkness· of the lake, so Clyde
     glides into the darkness of his thoughts. Two voices
                    THE    FIL M   SE N SE


     struggle within him-one: "Kill-kill!" the echo of his
     dark resolve, the frantic cry of all his hopes of Sondra
     and society; the other: "Don't-don't kill!" the expres­
     sion of his weakness and his fears, of his sadness for
     Roberta and his shame before her. In the scenes that
     folIo,,,, these voices ripple in the waves that lap from
     the oars against the boat; they whisper in the beating of
     his heart; they comment, underscoring, upon the mem­
     ories and alarums that pass through his mind; each ever
     struggling with the other for mastery, first one dominat­
     ing then weakening before the onset of its rival.
     They continue to murmur as he pauses on his oars to
     ask: "Did you speak to anyone in the hotel? "
     "No. Why do you ask?"
     "Nothing. I thought you might have met someone."

2 3 The voices shudder as Roberta smiles and shakes her
     head in answer, playfully letting her hand fall into the
     water.
     "It isn't cold, " she says.
     Clyde stops rowing and also feels the water. But his
     hand springs back as though it-had received an electric
     shock.

24   As he photographs her, the voices preoccupy him.
     While they picnic, or pick water-lilies, �hey possess him.
     As he jumps ashore a moment to put down his grip,
     the voices rise and torment him.

25   "Kill-kill," and Roberta happy, freshened by her faith
     in him, is radiant with the joy of living. "Don't kill-
              AN   AM ERI C A N   TRAGEDY                239
   don't kill, " and as the hoat drifts almost soundlessly by
   the dark pines and Clyde's face is racked by the struggle
   within him, there rises the long-drawn-out booming cry
   of a waterbird.

26 "Kill-kill" triumphs, and there passes' through his mind
    the memory of his mother. "Baby-baby" comes the
  - voice of his childhood and as "Don't kill-don't kill"
    rises he hears "Baby boy-baby boy" in the so different
    voice of Sondra, and at the image of Sondra and the
    thought of all that surrounds her "Kill-kill" grows
    harder and insistent, and with the thought of Roberta
    importunate it grows still harsher and shriller, and then
    the face of Roberta now, aglow with faith in him and
    her great relief, and the sight of the hair he has so loved
    to caress and "Don't-don't kill" grows and tenderly
    supplants the other and now is calm and firm and final.
   Ending the conflict. Sondra is lost forever.Never, never
    now will he have the courage to kill Roberta.

2 7 And we see Clyde as he sits in blank despair and the
  misery of renunciation. He raises his face from his
  hands.
  An oar drags in the water. In his left hand he holds
  the camera.
  And Clyde's face is so wild with misery and so stricken
  by the struggle that has passed behind it that Roberta
  crawls anxiously towards him and takes his hand in h�rs.

28 Clyde opens his eyes suddenly and sees near him her
  anxious, tender face. With an involuntary movement of
  reVl}lsion he pulls back his hand and jumps up quickly.
                      T H E FIL M   SE N S E


     As he does so the camera, quite accidentally, strikes her
     in the face. Roberta's lip is cut; she cries out and falls
     back in the stern of the boat.
     "I'm sorry, Roberta, I didn't mean to," and he makes a
     natural movement towards her. Roberta is afraid. She
     tries to get up, loses her balance, and the boat overturns.

29   Once more rings out the long-drawn booming cry of
     the bird. The overset boat floats on the surface of the
     water.
     Roberta's head appears above the surface.
     Clyde comes up. His face showing terrible fright, he
     makes a movement to help Roberta.
     Roberta, terrified by his f�ce, gives a piercing cry and,
     splashing frantically, disappears under the water. Clyde
     is about to dive down after her, but he stops, and hesi­
     tates.

30 And a third time the long-drawn booming cry of the
     far-away bird.
     On the mirror-like calmness of the water floats a straw
     hat.
     The wilderness of forest, the motionless hills. Dark
     water barely lapping against the shore.

3 I A noise of water is heard and Clyde is seen swimming
     to the shore. Reaching it, he first lies upon the earth,
     then slowly sits up, forgetting to lift one foot out of
     the water.
               AN AMERICAN     TRAGEDY
                   -      -


   Gradually he begins to shiver, the shivering increases,
   he pales and makes a familiar gesture, that gesture that
   he makes when frightened or suffering. He shrinks into
   himself and hides his head in his shoulders. He notices
   the foot in the water and lifts it out. He begins to think,
                                            '
   and with that, stops trembling. And the voice of his
  .thought.
   "Well, Roberta is gone-as you desired-and you didn't
   kill her-an accident-liberty-life-"
   And then very low, tenderly, as if whispering into his
   ear, the voice says:
   "Sondra."
   And Clyde closes his eyes. And in the darkness:
   "Sondra."
   Her laughter and her tender voice.
   "Sondra."

3 2 Clyde is feverishly clothing himself in the dry suit from
   his grip. Into the grip he packs the soaked suit, and
   then, getting up from his knees, he stretches to his full
   height, standing in the rays of the setting sun.

33 The sun vanishes behind the hills, behind the forest. The
   reflection vanishes from the lake, arid all becomes darker
   and darker.

34 Through the increasing dread of the darkling forest,
   Clyde is making his way, his grip in his hand. He starts,
   alar�ed by every noise, he is frightened by the cries of
   the night birds, he fears the moonlight penetrating be-
                      THE    FILM    SENSE


    tween the thick branches of the trees, he fears his own
    shadows and the shadows of the fantastic forest.
    He desires to see the time on his watch in the moonlight,
    but, when the lid is opened, water falls from it and he
    finds out that it has stopped. . . .

Title: FRIDAY
Rain beats mercilessly and ceaselessly upon the ground.
Title: JANUARY 28
The deluge continues.
Title: 1848
The deluge.
Sutter is seated, working, at an old writing desk.
The rain beats hopelessly on the windows.
Galloping horse's hooves are heard through the beat of the
    raIn.
Sutter lifts his head, gets up and, gun . in hand, goes to the
    window. .
The sound of the galloping hooves comes closer.
The door is flung open and, along with a gust of rain, a
   man· soaked by the downpour rushes into the room,
   overturning two chairs.
"Marsnall! "
                             243
                    THE   FILM   SENSE


-shouts Sutter, and runs to meet him.
Marshall is in a frenzy of excitement-and out of breath.
   Exhausted by his furious ride, he cannot speak at first.
But through his broken and choked sounds, it becomes
    clear that his news is secret-he motions for the door
    to be shut.
Sutter closes the. door.
Marshall manages to take a package from his pocket, and
    tries to unfold it with his trembling fingers.
The door is opened-by one of Sutter's clerks in search of
   something.
Marshall hastily thrusts the package back into his pocket­
    glaring at the man.
Innocently and unhurriedly the clerk finds what he needs
    and leaves.
Marshall shuts the door after him, comes close to Sutter
   and again takes out the little package, starting to un­
   fold it.
A   servant girl comes into the room.
Marshall hides the package.
This time he thrusts the girl out of the room, slamming the
    door.
Failing to find a key, Marshall shoves a table against the
     door.
Marshall's trembling fingers are holding the unfolded paper,
    showing some tiny grains of metal.
Title: GOLD?
                              '
                     SUT T E R S   GOLD                245
Title: GOLD?
Title: GOLD?
As hands complete a chemical test on the grains, Sutter's
    voice answers quietly and certainly:"
"G9Id."
Sutter stands at the table-the gold and reagent are in his
    hands, and grief fills his face. He repeats-even more
    quietly:
"Gold."
Title: GOLD. As the word zooms forward, filling the
    screen, we hear in a parallel rising inhuman roar­
    "Gold!"
"Gold!"
                                                    "
-shrieks Marshall at the top of his voice-overturning the
    table, he flings the door open and rushes into the yard.
Sutter rushes to the window, opens it, and into the rain
    that drives in, shouts after Marshall:
"Stop. Stop! "
Unheeding, Marshall gallops away through the downpour.
In the center of the room-with its overturned table, its
    leaning cupboard, its scattered papers tossed by the
    wind that" is blowing in the rain through the open
    window and the door swinging on its hinges-stan�s
    Sutter, staring with foreboding at the gold on the"
    table.
A gust of wind blows out the light. The dim outlines of
   the wind-swept room slowly fade out.
          /




In a long fade-in-
                   THE    FIL M   SEN SE


-a gray and misty morning.
Sutter dismounts from horseback near his Coloma sawmill
    at the spot where the first gold was discovered.
At the mill the Indian workers are in the grip of supersti­
    tious horror.
They say that the gold belongs to the devil-they have al­
   ways known of it, and avoided it-and they implore
   Sutter not to touch it.
Sutter replies that the first job is to complete the construc-
    tion of his sawmill-no matter what happens.
He urges them to keep the discovery secret.
They all pledge secrecy.
And Sutter, on his way home-
-passes through the prosperous landscapes of a happy coun­
    tryside..
Wealth, fertility and contentment can be sensed every­
   where.
The rain has ceased, nature's garment is soft and sparkling.
    Myriads of raindrops shimmer in the sunshine.
Suddenly he meets a group of working people with picks,
    and pans for gold-washing.
Astonished, Sutter follows them with his. eyes, then turns
    his horse and gallops towards the fort.
The store-keeper from near the fort comes up to Sutter to
   show him gold dust in the palm of his hand.
He asks Sutter if this is really gold or not.
Sutter nods slowly.
                               '
                     SU T T E R S   GOLD                    247
The man shouts: - "Gold!� Gold!"-and
Sutter, nervous and shaken, rides through the gate of the
    fort.
The store-keeper nails up the door of his store.
Everything he owns is flung into a wagon.
His helper steal!: two of Sutter's horses from the corral.
The store-keeper drives off furiously towards the Gold.
Two Indians have stopped their work in the fields to listen
   to a woman who, with much gesticulation, is telling
   them the news.
Flinging down their hoes, the Indians follow the store­
    keeper.
The herdsman deserts his animals.
A   husband abandons �is wife and children. They weep
     and plead, but he abandons them.
The schoolmaster leaves his school and his pupils.
Whole groups of Sutter's workers set out on the road.
More and more people stop working to join the human
   flood.
Fields and homes are empty, deserted.
Sutter places' on his finger a ring with the inscription:   FIRST
     GOLD FOUND 1848.

Engraved upon the ring is the coat-of-arms of his native
   town.
Picks] shovels and crowbars begin to bite jnto the earth.
                   THE   FIL M   SE N SE


The sound of sand moving in the wooden working-pans,
   the s\vash of the swinging water, begins to be heard
   through the forests and fields.
The noise of picks, and of stones cast from the working­
   pans, grows louder and louder, ever more and more
   insistent.
These sounds pervade the whole land.
And beneath this tearing sound, the dominion of Sutter
   falls to waste and rot from its own fertility and luxuri­
   ance.
The boughs of fruit-trees are cracking with their burden
   of ripe fruit.
Barrels are exploding with an over-fermentation of their
    wine and beer.
Horses, untended and unfoddered, break down the bars of
   their corrals and rush into the wheat-fields.
Cows fill the air with their lowings of pain, and maddened
   by their unrelieved udders, burst through the walls of
   the stables, trampling flowers and vegetables.
High-piled sacks of grain burst with the tension of their
    stacked weight, and the spilt running grain scatters in
   the wind.
The dams are taut with their heavy loads, the canal locks
   are shattered, and the waters rush through their old
   courses.
Sutter wanders alone through this desolation, listening to
    the incessant sound of the gold-seekers.
"Gold." The word rings through the forest, and echoes
   through the hills and canyons.
                                 '
                         SUT T ER S G O L D               249
And then, from the depths of these canyons, a new theme
   of the noise symphony can be heard.
The sounds of thousands of feet trampling over stones.
The sounds of endless trails of creaking wagons.
                                        ,
The mixed sounds of horses' hooves and screeching wagon
   wheels.
And the murmur of limitless crowds.
The first of the wagons appears near the fort.
A savage-looking man tears out some flowers by the roots,
    and stabs his sharpened tent-pole into the earth.
The sound of the approaching procession grows louder
   and nearer.
Sutter sits on a hill.
His old dog is huddled against him.
The sounds are nearer-he can distinguish human voices.
They tell of the great distances that they have come-and
   he realizes that there is no end to this human flood.
Through these sounds can be heard the chopping of axes,
   falling trees, the whistling of saws, crashing trees.
Pigs are screaming, and frightened ducks quack frantically
    as they �re pursued by the invaders.
Sutter is driven wild by these sounds. The picks grow
    louder, and now the sound of stone striking stone�
    stones piled high from out of the river-bed, stones
    burying the fertile fields. Stones gro\ving into moun­
             "
    tains that crush all the fertility that preceded this ter­
    rible symphony of sounds.
                   THE   FILM       SENSE


Darkness, and the crackling of a little fire that lights the
    silent face of Sutter.
The sounds of destruction swell to colossal proportions.
Sutter is in an agony of despair.
And the saws continue to whine, and the axes to chop,
   and the trees to crash and the picks to hammer upon
   the stones.
The gold-diggers curse in the fever of their hunt.
These things madden Sutter, and he takes refuge in the
   darkness of the forest.. .   .

              QUE VIVA MEXICO!


 - This incomplete autograph draft of an outline sent to
Upton Sinclair before beginning the production of Que
Viva Mexico! is now in the Eisenstein Collection at the
Museum of Modern Art Film Library. Compare with item
39 of the Bibliography.



      ROUGH OUTLINE OF THE MEXICAN PICTURE
   (and   "plausum date"   for style, orthography, etc.!)
Do you know what a "Serape" is? A Serape is the striped
blanket that the Mexican indio, the Mexican charro-every
Mexican wears. And the Serape could be the symbol of
Mexico. So striped and violently contrasting are the cultures
in Mexico running next to each other and at the same time
being centuries away. No plot, no whole story could run
through this Serape without being false or artificial. And
we took the contrasting independent adjacence of its vio­
lent colors as the motif for constructing our film: 6 epi­
sodes following each other-different in character, different
in people, different in animals, trees and Rowers. And still
held together by the unity of the weave-a rhythmic and
musical construction and an unrolling of the Mexican spirit.
and character.
  Death. Skulls of people. And skulls of stone. The horrible
Aztec gods and the terrifying -Yucatan deities. Huge ruins.
Pyramids. A world that was and is no more. Endless rows
of stones and columns. And faces. Faces of stone. And
                             251

The unity of death and life.The passing of one and the
birth of the next one. The eternal circle. And the still
greater wisdom of Mexico: the enjoying of this eternal
circle.Death-Day in Mexico.Day of the greatest fun and
merriment. The day vv'hen Mexico provokes death and
makes fun of it-death is but a step to another cycle of life
-why then fear it! Hat stores display skulls wearing top
and straw hats. Candy takes the shape of skulls in sugar
and coffins of confectionery. Parties go to the cemetery,
taking food to the dead.Parties play and sing on the graves.
And the food of the dead is eaten by the living.The drink­
ing and the singing grow louder.And night covers Death
Day.Death Day that is becoming birth day for new lives,
for new arrivals.And from beneath the terrifying skull of
the grotesque death masquerade and fiesta peeps the smil­
ing face of a new baby establishing the unmovable law of
death following life and life following death.

cattle and Indians. Through dances in ancient fashioned
robes, gold, silk and embroidery-follows the love story of
the young woman.Through customs and rites the story
moves from love to wedding. And from the wedding "San­
dunga" (dance) to the lucky palm-shaded new home. A
new home overshadowed by the snowy white "weepeel"­
the mountain-like headdress of the triumphant mother and
wife.
   The snowy serenity.
   Snowy like the gray-haired Popocatepetl.


   But harsh, rough, cruel and thorny is the vegetation at
his feet. Cruel, rough and harsh like the male tribe of
"charros," farmers, Mexican cowboys and hacendados who
live among it. The endless field of maguey-the prickling
sharp-leaved cactus. Leaves· through which in an endless
effort the indio sucks the sap of the earth's heart-the
sweet honey-like r.'aguamiel"-which when treated becomes
"pulque." Reli�f of sorrows-the Mexican brandy.And sor­
rows are abundant. There is nothing of the aguamiel's
sweetness in the tall and bony hacendado, his guards and
his major-domos. And lower b.ends the back of the indio
with his little donkey that all day drags the precious load
of aguamiel from the boundless fields to the fortress-like
hacienda. These are the days of Diaz (before the Revolu­
tion of 19 Io-which changed entirely the living conditions

different in handling and treatment.)


   But the grotesque laughing of the stone heads becomes
still more grotesque in the cardboard "pinata" faces­
Christmas dolls.And then becomes voluptuous in the suf­
fering smile of the Catholic polychrome saints.Statues of
saints that were erected on the sites of pagan altars.Bleed­
ing and distorted like the human sacrifices that were made
on the top of these pyramids. Here, like imported and
anemic flowers bloom the iron and fire of the Catholicism

of Guadalupe worshiped by wild dances and bloody bull­
fights.By tower-high Indian hair-dresses and Spanish man­
tillas. By exhausting hours-long dances in sunshine and
dust, by miles of knee-creeping penitence, and the golden
ballets of bull-fighting cuadrillas... .

     A shooting-script by Eisenstein, from a treatment by
Piotr Pavlenko and Eisenstein. This first draft of the un­
produced script is dated August      1-2-3, 1939. Of the pub­
lished    657 shot indications, only the first 145 are repro­
duced below, forming a fourteenth-century prologue to
the modern drama of Soviet Uzbekistan's reclamation of
its desert wastes. In the film's Tamerlane will be found
more resemblance to Adolf Hitler than to the heroic figure
of Marlowe's tragedy.

   yard suddenly stretch Qut their arms towards the
   mosque.

   held the city of Urganj under siege.
